## Regions

The Cloud Temple infrastructure is designed to ensure the business continuity of your applications and platforms. 
Within a region, you benefit from level 2 network continuity.

Thus, it is possible to define a technical architecture in the Paris region, using 3 physical sites to enable the implementation of a high availability platform with quorum.

As of January 2024, the Cloud Temple IaaS platform has the following regions:

- Region FR1 (Paris)

### Region FR1

The FR1 region is based on three physical sites in the Paris region.

Each site is more than 30km as the crow flies from the others. On average, there is 80km of optical distance between each site. The guaranteed latency between sites is less than 4 ms.

### Regional Extensions

The opening of new regions is mainly associated with market opportunities. As of January 2024, the opening of a region in Southern Europe and a region in Northern Europe are under consideration.
