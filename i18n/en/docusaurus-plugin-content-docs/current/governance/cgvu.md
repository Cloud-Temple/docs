and any entity, whether a natural person or a legal entity, acting as a consumer or professional,
private or public law, having subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offer

## 4. Purpose

The purpose of this Contract is to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider agrees to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, the execution modalities of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT enters into this contract in its own name and on its behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously reviewed, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is highly recommended to seek the expertise of an IT and networks specialist before accepting these terms. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, especially concerning the selection of the proposed units of work characteristics and the determination of the resources necessary to meet specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves invalid under applicable legislation or an irrevocable court decision, this provision will be deemed unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract or the strength of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Service Provider, it is mandatory for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. In the context of creating and managing this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Service Provider with all the necessary data for proper contract execution. These data include, but are not limited to, the email address, identity, and contact information, as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information throughout the duration of the Contract.

In case the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must certify and ensure to the Service Provider that they have the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and commit it in accordance with contractual provisions.

### 6.2. CLIENT Account Activation

Before activating the CLIENT Account, and at any time during service delivery, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on its behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents for the communicated information. The Service Provider also has the right to refuse activation or proceed with deactivation of the CLIENT Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Ordering

Once its CLIENT Account has been activated by the Service Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, orders can be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing its CLIENT Account, including securing authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it. 

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered as being made by the CLIENT themselves, and implies their full and complete adherence to the Contract terms. The terms and delivery times of the ordered Services vary depending on the type of required Service. Some Services will only be available after the Service Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to ensure that the Service delivery conditions meet their requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. However, in case of contradiction or discrepancy between them, precedence will be given to the documents in the order they were listed. The appendices of the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical clarification without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts made under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) are concluded for an indefinite duration unless otherwise stipulated in the Special Conditions, which would provide for a fixed duration. 

Termination of the Contract is only possible by complying with the modalities specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the full recovery of its data stored under the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Recovery and Deletion".

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay for the Services already provided.
## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services and their use are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Agreement, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Agreement, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them later.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is contingent upon the prior agreement of the parties following a joint assessment.

## 10. Conditions of Service Use

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT agrees to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use. 
The use of the Services must be done responsibly. Specifically, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize himself with the current General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU) and to adhere to all the guidelines provided at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, he is obliged, before any use by them, to make them aware of and accept the current conditions of use. The CLIENT thus ensures the Provider of full compliance with these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Selection of Services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully review the current Terms of Use as well as to thoroughly analyze all the documentation, configurations, options, and service ranges offered, in order to select Services and characteristics that precisely match his needs and those of the third parties using the Services on his behalf or for his account. 

The CLIENT ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted through the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. 
It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of any potential changes, especially when placing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires the CLIENT to have, at his own expense and responsibility, an adequate remote connection 
(such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical issues 
and present security risks that go beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the scope of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operator 
(including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth fluctuations, service interruptions, etc.), 
nor the potential impacts of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the credentials and passwords necessary 
to access and use the Services. He must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or misuse of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances can the Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to promptly notify the Provider 
in the event of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication means, and to immediately initiate the replacement or reset procedures for these means.

### 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from accessing this content, except when strictly necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not carry out any verification, validation, or updating of the mentioned content.

Similarly, he does not ensure dedicated backup of the content stored via the Services. It is therefore up to the CLIENT to take the necessary measures for the backup of his content, in order to protect against any risk of loss or damage, for any reason, notably through the use of appropriate units of work in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used following best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. 
The use of illegal content (such as dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content advocating crimes, 
inciting hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any violation of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, 
or even termination of the Agreement solely at the CLIENT's fault. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to take legal action or claim damages for the harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

Services must be used responsibly, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain aware 
of legislative and regulatory changes. Specifically prohibited practices include, but are not limited to:

1. abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources, that may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems,
that may affect the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts of intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, 
spoofing, and any form of attack emanating from the provided resources, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices; 
4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in case of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data; 
2. the execution of planned maintenance operations; 
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities; 
4. alerts received pursuant to article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN); 
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Agreement.

This suspension can be immediate, without prior notice, in case of a critical situation or to prevent illegal or fraudulent use of the Services, 
a violation of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Provider's liability.
The Provider strives, as much as possible and unless required by law or violation of the terms of use, 
to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from his obligation to pay 
the amounts due under the Agreement. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenances via a dedicated interface.

In case of the CLIENT's failure to meet his obligations, these suspensions are without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate 
the Agreement or seek damages. Unless in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions do not 
entail the deletion of the CLIENT's data. Unless they are solely due to the Provider's fault, these interruptions are not 
considered as unavailability of the Services for the purpose of the service level commitments stipulated in the Agreement.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Provider reserves the right, at its discretion, to make any modifications to the Services, including adding, modifying or 
removing ranges, options, features, and improving their performance. The detailed description of the Services 
is available on the Provider's website. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of Service updates, 
which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also happen immediately in response to urgent needs, 
such as security risks or compliance requirements, or following changes to third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update causes a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example,
the removal of a feature or a drop in performance —, the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, he must send a notification
of termination by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt request, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider—including software, infrastructures, documentations, and others—remain the exclusive property
of the Provider or its assignees. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements,
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that,
aside from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for elements
and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that they choose to use or exploit within the context of the Services.

The CLIENT and its Users remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits to not exploiting this content
for purposes other than those specified in the contract. In accordance with current laws, the CLIENT is obligated not to decompile the software,
codes, and algorithms made available within the framework of the Services, including any attempts at reverse engineering, unless legally authorized
to bypass this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT’s activities, the Provider
guarantees that the Services are commercially viable and usable within the European Union and in the hosting countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the responsibility of the CLIENT, if they intend to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside the European borders, to ensure that this use
complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009,
on the export control of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations)
and the ‘ITAR’ (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions,
or from individuals or legal entities from these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including creditworthiness and potential CLIENT presence
on sanctions lists, such as the asset-freeze list of the Directorate General of the Treasury, may be conducted. Following these checks,
the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In line with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. The Provider disclaims all liability regarding Third-Party Products provided within the framework of the Services.
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility, or stability issues. The Provider offers
no warranty related to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.
2. The use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. Specifically, it is forbidden for the CLIENT to decompile,
access source codes, or reinstall Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures.
The responsibility for using Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for their specific needs and objectives,
while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, non-renewal,
interruption of Services by the CLIENT, violation of contract terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations,
result in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements)
that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, distributed, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the framework of the Services,
including any backups.

### 10.13. Intrusion Test

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically appointed external auditor, intrusion tests on the provided Services
(referred to here as “Intrusion Tests”). These tests may only be performed after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved
in the provision of the Service, including CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, as well as their subcontractors if applicable.
These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of users and rights holders in the tested area.

The conditions for performing these Intrusion Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor,
adopting the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility
of the CLIENT. The Intrusion Tests must not under any circumstances:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider’s Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising
from the Intrusion Tests, including those resulting from actions conducted by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT’s responsibility to make all necessary backups
before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, potentially causing
temporary unavailability of Services. The CLIENT must inform any affected party by this unavailability. After the Intrusion Tests,
an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of vulnerability discovery).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential
and must not be published or shared without the Provider’s written consent. In case of a breach of established conditions, the Provider
reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential compensation.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge being subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to communicating
any information and document likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees that they have the authority and capacity to conclude the Contract and perform their obligations. The CLIENT and the Provider specifically declare and guarantee that they have all authorizations, skills,
and knowledge (especially technical) enabling them to use and provide the Services in accordance with the Contract’s terms.

### 12.2. Provider’s Liability

When the Contract specifies service level commitments, penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as a lump-sum compensation for
any damages arising from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action on this basis.
If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum liability of the Provider is limited to the total amount paid by the CLIENT
for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation request.

**Disclaimer: The Provider’s liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:**

- Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than Provider’s subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or CLIENT’s neglect;
- Indirect damages such as commercial loss, order loss, decreased business, reputational damage, profit loss, or customer loss, particularly due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, a third-party lawsuit, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with article 6 "Terms of Use", including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to CLIENT’s needs (especially considering the sensitivity of the concerned data);
- Security incidents related to the use of the Internet, especially in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to CLIENT’s data or information on or from the Internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT's Responsibility

The CLIENT is entirely responsible for the risks associated with their activities, including the use of Services provided by the Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This responsibility extends to the cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet access 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
