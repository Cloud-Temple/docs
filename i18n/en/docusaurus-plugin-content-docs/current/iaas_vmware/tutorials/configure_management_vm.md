This tutorial guides you through the configuration of a virtual machine dedicated to managing your Cloud Temple infrastructure.



## Prerequisites

- Access to the Cloud Temple console
- Permissions for managing virtual machines
- VM template available in the catalog



## Overview

A management virtual machine is essential for securely managing your Cloud Temple infrastructure. It serves as a centralized entry point for managing your resources.



## Step 1: Deployment of the management VM



### Template selection

1. Access the **Virtual Machines** section in the console
2. Click on **Create a virtual machine**
3. Select a template suitable for management (Windows Server or Linux)
4. Configure the resources according to your needs



### Network configuration

1. Assign the VM to the appropriate management network  
2. Configure a static IP address  
3. Ensure the VM can access the resources to manage



## Step 2: Security Configuration



### System Hardening

1. Apply the latest security updates
2. Configure a local firewall
3. Disable unnecessary services
4. Configure user accounts with appropriate privileges



### Authentication

1. Configure strong authentication (MFA if possible)
2. Integrate the VM into your corporate directory if necessary
3. Configure robust password policies



## Step 3: Installation of management tools



### VMware Tools

1. Install VMware Tools for optimal integration
2. Configure the monitoring tools
3. Install the necessary administration clients



### Monitoring Tools
