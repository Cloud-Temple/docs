This tutorial helps you encrypt a VMware IaaS virtual machine from the Shiva portal.

### Prerequisites

1. **Key provider (HSM/KMS)** :
   - A key provider must be configured on the vStack. (If no key provider is configured, please contact the support service through a ticket.)
   - Ensure the key provider is correctly activated.

2. **Virtual machine status** :
   - The virtual machine must be powered off.
   - The virtual machine must not be in 'test' spp mode.
   - The virtual machine must not already be encrypted.
   - The virtual machine must not have snapshots.
   - The virtual machine must not be replicated.

### Interface

Once connected to the Shiva web portal, from the **'IaaS'** menu, under the **'Configuration'** submenu and the **'vCenters'** tab, you will find information indicating whether encryption is enabled on the relevant vStack.

Then go to the **'Virtual Machines'** submenu and select the machine you want to encrypt.

In the virtual machine's general information, you will find information indicating whether the machine is already encrypted or not.

If the virtual machine meets the prerequisites, you can proceed with the procedure by clicking the button with a lock icon in the toolbar indicating **'Encrypt the Virtual Machine'**.
