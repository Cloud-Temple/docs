Here is an example of configuring the authentication repository of a Cloud Temple organization with __Microsoft EntraID__ (Azure Active Directory).

Configuring your Microsoft repository at the level of a Cloud Temple organization facilitates authentication of your users on the Shiva console. This helps avoid the multiplication of authentication factors and reduce the attack surface.

If your users are authenticated to their Microsoft account, authentication to the Shiva console services will be transparent.

Here are the different steps to perform this configuration:



## Step 1: SSO Configuration on the Microsoft Azure Side



### Registering a new Azure application (Azure portal)

For the __application registration__, go to the Microsoft Azure portal, then in Microsoft Entra ID, select __"ADD > App Registration"__.

On the "Register an application" page, please indicate:

```
- __Name__ : Enter "__SHIVA__"
- __Supported account types__ :  __Accounts in this organizational directory only__ (__<Your Azure Tenant>__ only - Single tenant)
- __Redirect URL__ : Do not configure initially. The URL will be provided by Cloud Temple support and should be added in this field later.
```

<img src={ssoEntra_001} />

The __Application (client) ID__ and __Directory (tenant) ID__ are the information to provide in the support request to the Cloud Temple team to enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication at your organization.

### Definition of a secret

In the "Certificates & secrets" tab, create a new secret.

*Note: the expiration date of the secret cannot be more than 24 months, including with a custom expiration date.*

<img src={ssoAad_004} />

The generated secret will need to be provided in the support request:

<img src={ssoAad_005} />



### Definition of EntraID token

The EntraID token is necessary for authentication configuration.

In the __"Token Configuration"__ menu, click on __"Add optional claim"__. You will need to select "ID" as the token type and check "email".

<img src={ssoAad_006} />

The Azure interface will ask if you want to add a permission that will allow you to read a user's email (Microsoft Graph email), check the box and confirm.

<img src={ssoAad_007} />

Then go to "API permissions" and click on __"Grant admin consent for Cloud Temple"__.

<img src={ssoAad_008} />



### Additional Security Configurations (optional but recommended)

By default, Microsoft EntraID as configured will allow any user in your Azure tenant to connect to your Cloud Temple organization.
It is possible to restrict access at the __"App Registration"__ level to allow only a list of users or groups to connect to your Cloud Temple organization.

Here is the procedure to follow;



#### Access the Additional Settings "App Registration"



##### Option 1

Go to the "Overview" tab and click on the application name (the link located after "Managed application").

<img src={ssoAad_009} />



##### Option 2

Go to "Enterprise applications" and search using the name of the previously created application.

<img src={ssoAad_010} />



#### Authentication Restriction for Users Assigned to the Application

Indicate here the necessity of assigning the user to the application to authorize their authentication:

<img src={ssoAad_011} />



#### User and Group Assignment to the Application

Only the groups and users assigned to the application will be able to connect to your Cloud Temple organization via the app registration.

<img src={ssoAad_012} />

Finally, you will only need to apply the assignment by clicking "Assign".

<img src={ssoAad_013} />

From now on, the users assigned to the application will be able to connect to your Cloud Temple organization via the created application.



## Step 2: Request your organization's SSO (Single Sign-On) configuration

This part of the configuration is handled at the organization level by the Cloud temple team.

To proceed, make __a support request__ in the console indicating your desire to set up a Microsoft EntraID SSO.

Please provide the following information in the support request:
    The name of your Organization
    The name of a contact with their email and phone number to finalize the configuration
    Application ID (unique identifier associated with the previously created application)
    Directory ID (corresponds to the Azure AD tenant ID of the Azure directory)
    Secret (secret associated with the previously created application)

Once the configuration is completed on the Shiva console, the designated contact will be notified.



## Step 3: Finalizing the Configuration

On the App Registration home page, in the overview menu, click on "Add a Redirect URL".

<img src={ssoAad_014} />

Next, go to "Add a platform" and add one of type Web.

<img src={ssoAad_015} />

You just need to enter the "Redirect URL" provided by the Applications Product Team.

<img src={ssoAad_016} />

You should get this result once the "Redirect URL" is added.

<img src={ssoAad_017} />

The "Redirect URL" configuration may take a few minutes to take effect.
Once all steps are completed, you can authenticate to your Cloud Temple organization via your SSO.
