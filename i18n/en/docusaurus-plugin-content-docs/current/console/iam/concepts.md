## Users

Access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the sponsor's master account upon invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).

Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organizations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#authentication-mechanisms)*

### Creating a User Account in Your Organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done via invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](#organizations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen, on the green banner, then select the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click the __'New User'__ button from the users page.

Next, enter the user's email address.

<img src={shivaOnboard_004} />

The user will then receive a verification email.

<img src={shivaOnboard_001} />

Once verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Assigning Permissions to a User

User rights management is performed from the user page.

<img src={shivaOnboard_003} />

By default, a user has no permissions. Therefore, the administrator who sent the invitation must assign the necessary rights for the user's activities. Simply click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and select the __'Edit'__ option.

The permissions activation menu then appears:

<img src={shivaOnboard_005} />

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenant) within the [Organization](#organizations).

The list of permissions and their definitions is available [here](#permissions).

### Re-enrollment of a User

When a user has been provisioned but did not validate their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. In such cases, it is possible to resend a link so the user can renew their initial registration.

To re-enroll a user, go to the __'User'__ tab in the Administration panel, located at the bottom-left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-enroll, then click the action button at the end of the row and choose __'Re-enrollment'__.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the original requester of the re-enrollment for your user account. Please report any requests that do not originate from you via a support ticket.

### Update Your Profile

This action is available only for local accounts (non-SSO).

Go to your __'Profile'__, located in the top-right corner of the screen, then select __'User Settings'__ and choose the __'Update Your Profile'__ action.

Next, go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the original requester of the profile update. Please report any requests that do not originate from you via a support ticket.

### Password Reset

This action is available only for local accounts (non-SSO).

Go to your __'Profile'__, located in the top-right corner of the screen, then select __'User Settings'__ and choose the __'Reset Password'__ action.

Next, go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one initiating the password reset request. Please report any requests that do not originate from you via a support ticket.

### Reset Multi-Factor Authentication

This action is available only for local accounts (non-SSO).

Go to your __'Profile'__, located in the top-right corner of the screen, then select __'User Settings'__ and choose the __'Reset MFA'__ action.

Next, go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your multi-factor authentication.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one initiating the request to reset your multi-factor authentication. Please report any requests that do not originate from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a User

To delete a user, go to the __'User'__ tab in the Administration panel, located in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

Select the user you wish to delete, then click the action button at the end of the row and choose __'Delete'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_013} />
<img src={shivaProfil_010} />

Note: You cannot delete yourself, and you cannot delete a user marked as __'Owner'__.

### Sign Out

To sign out a user, go to their __'Profile'__, located in the top right corner of the screen, then select __'Sign Out'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_009} />
<img src={shivaProfil_011} />

Automatic sign-out occurs when the session's JWT token expires.

### Change the language of a user

Changing a user's language is done in their __'Profile'__, located in the top-right corner of the screen, under __'User Settings'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

The configuration is set individually for each tenant [Tenant](#tenant).

### Thematic Notifications Subscription

Managing subscriptions allows you to receive emails related to activated themes, automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

This feature is accessible in the user profile, under the "My Subscriptions" tab:

<img src={shivaProfil_007} />

For example, in the event of an incident, specific email notifications for this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes may evolve and gradually expand to adapt to our operational needs and changes in the environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows for fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant.  
Initially, it is the primary account of the sponsor that enables the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.  
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ permission allows an account to manage the permissions of other users.

### Available Permissions for Users in Your Organization

When a user is created, they have no permissions by default. Each permission is assigned individually and operates in isolation, without overlap with other permissions. Permissions are applied in conjunction, meaning a user must possess all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and for each tenant in your organization:

- **"read" permissions**: Allow only resource viewing, with no ability to modify them.
- **"write" permissions**: Permit modification of configurations.
- **"management" permissions**: Enable advanced resource management.
- **"console_access" permissions**: Allow PMAD-style connections to resources.
- **"virtual_machine_power" permissions**: Enable power management of virtual machines.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, both READ and WRITE permissions are required to modify a configuration.

## Organizations

An organization is linked to your __sponsor account__ and the associated __Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, etc.) that holds the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Organization Principle

An organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for tracking and billing purposes,
- It defines the __global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It manages all __user accounts__,
- It __federates tenants__ (Production, Staging, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for your Cloud architecture needs.

User roles (rights/permissions) are configurable for each tenant defined within your organization. For example, a user account may be authorized to provision resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The Shiva console allows organizations to __configure the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can either use the Shiva console's built-in local authentication directory or connect your organization to one of your external authentication directories.

The following external authentication directories are supported:

- OpenID Connect-compatible directories,
- SAML-compatible directories,
- Microsoft ADFS
- Microsoft EntraID (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- Keycloak

:::info[Important]
An email address is required for all accounts originating from an identity federation. Accounts created without an email address will not be able to log in and may be automatically deleted.
:::

## Tenant

A tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organizations) has at least one tenant (called the __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Typically, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical boundaries.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant  
- A __Pre-production__ tenant  
- A __Testing__ tenant  
- A __Qualification__ tenant  

It is also possible to organize tenants based on an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- An __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__ tenant  
- An __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__ tenant  
- ...

Technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a hypervisor cluster and its associated L2 networks are available only within one tenant.  
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __cross-tenant__ networks to ensure network continuity across tenants.

User permissions must be defined within each tenant. Therefore, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This aspect is typically addressed during the initial workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must be initialized with a minimum set of resources:

- A zone of availability (AZ, i.e., a physical datacenter),  
- A compute cluster,  
- A storage space,  
- A network VLAN.

| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activate a zone of availability      | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |

### Owner Management on a Tenant

Each tenant has at least one owner, ensuring clear accountability and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to designate multiple owners for a single tenant, enabling collaboration and shared decision-making. Below are important considerations to keep in mind when managing these owners.

#### Important Information on Owner Management

#### 1. Number of Owners

* There is no technical limit on the number of owners that can be defined for the tenant.
- The management interface (UI) issues a warning when more than 3 owners are present, encouraging the limitation of the number of owners for security reasons and optimal access management.

#### 2. Adding a new owner

* When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes.
- This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied across all associated services and resources.

#### 2. Owner Permissions

* An owner will be granted all permissions associated with the products enabled in their tenant.
- It is not possible to modify the permissions of an owner.

#### 3. Removing a Owner

* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
- This procedure ensures that changes to access rights are made securely and in compliance with best practices for access management.

### Access Permission to a Tenant: Allowed IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses, in compliance with the SecNumCloud certification requirements. This restriction ensures a heightened level of security by allowing access only from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *Removing an authorized IP requires a support request via the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource Consumption within a Tenant

It is possible to visualize cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of various deployed services. This feature enables users to monitor resource consumption in real time, identify the most heavily used services, and optimize resource utilization according to their needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" and then select the desired time period. You will then be able to view detailed cloud resource consumption over the specified period, allowing you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
