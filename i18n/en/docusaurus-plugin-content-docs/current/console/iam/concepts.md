## Users

Access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the sponsor's master account through invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).
Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left of your screen on the green banner, then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the users page.

Then enter the user's email address.

<img src={shivaOnboard_004} />

The user will then receive a verification email.

<img src={shivaOnboard_001} />

Once verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user page.

<img src={shivaOnboard_003} />

By default, a user has no rights. It is therefore necessary for the administrator who sent the invitation to grant the rights needed for their activity. Simply click on the __'Actions'__ menu of the user and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

<img src={shivaOnboard_005} />

The permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions is accessible [here](#permissions).

### Re-registering a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not validated their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is then possible to send them a link so they can renew their initial registration.

Re-registering a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to re-register, then click on the action button at the end of the line and choose __'Re-registration'__.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the originator of the re-registration request for your user account. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Updating your profile

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Update your profile'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the originator of the profile update request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_014} />

### Resetting your password

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Reset password'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the originator of the password reset request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_015} />

### Resetting two-factor authentication

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the originator of the request to reset your two-factor authentication. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line and choose __'Delete'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_013} />
<img src={shivaProfil_010} />

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out is done from your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'Log out'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_009} />
<img src={shivaProfil_011} />

An automatic logout occurs when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing a user's language

Changing a user's language is done from their __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, in the __'User settings'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

The configuration is done for each [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscribing to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes that will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My subscriptions" tab:

<img src={shivaProfil_007} />

For example, in the event of an incident, email notifications specific to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is likely to evolve and be progressively enriched to adapt to the needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the sponsor's main account that allows the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer the permissions of other users.

### Available permissions for users in your organization

When a user is created, they do not have any permissions by default. Each permission is assigned individually and functions unitarily, without overlapping with other permissions. They apply in conjunction, meaning a user must have all the required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and for each tenant of your organization:
 • "read" type permissions: only allow viewing resources without the possibility of modification.
 • "write" type permissions: allow modifying configurations.
  • "management" type permissions: allow advanced resource management.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permission to modify a configuration.

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your __sponsor account__ and the __associated Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, etc.) that carries the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It holds all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Pre-production, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, etc.) that you define for the needs of your Cloud architecture.

The roles (rights/permissions) of users are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in one tenant, but not in another.

### Authentication mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __the configuration of the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can
use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or connect your organization to one of
your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- __OpenID Connect__ compatible repositories,
- __SAML__ compatible repositories,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak

## Tenant

The tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has at least one tenant (called the __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Generally, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical perimeters.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Pre-production__ tenant
- A __Testing__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- An __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__ tenant
- An __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__ tenant
- ...

The technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and the associated L2 networks are only available in 1 tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is generally addressed in an initialization workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.

|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Tenant activation                      | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Availability zone activation           | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |

### Management of owners on a tenant

Each tenant has at least one owner, ensuring clear responsibility and effective management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to declare multiple owners on the same tenant, allowing for collaboration and shared decision-making. Below, you will find important information to consider when managing these owners.

#### Important information about owner management

#### 1. Number of owners

* There is no technical limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
- The management interface (GUI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.

#### 2. Adding a new owner

* When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may require a delay of up to 60 minutes.
- This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are properly applied to all associated services and resources.

#### 2. Owner permissions

* An owner will be granted all permissions related to the products activated on their tenant.
- It is not possible to modify an owner's permissions.

#### 3. Removing an owner

* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
- This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are made securely and in compliance with best practices for access management.

### Tenant access authorization: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses, in compliance with SecNumCloud qualification requirements. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risks of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an authorized IP is done through a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource consumption within a tenant

It is possible to view the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the utilization of the different deployed services. This feature allows users to track their resource consumption in real time, identify the most used services, and optimize their usage based on needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" then select the desired time period. You will be able to view the cloud resource consumption in detail over the defined period, allowing you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
