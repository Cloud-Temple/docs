### Deleting a user

Deleting a user must be done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to delete, then click the action button at the end of the line and then __'Delete'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_013} />
<img src={shivaProfil_010} />

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a user __'Owner'__.

#### 2. Owner permissions

* An owner will be granted all permissions related to the products activated on their tenant.
- It is not possible to modify an owner's permissions.

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your __sponsor account__ and the __associated Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, ...) that holds the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Log out

User logout is performed in their __'Profile'__, top right of the screen, then __'Log out'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_009} />
<img src={shivaProfil_011} />

An automatic logout occurs when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

## Users

Access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the client's master account via invitation (regardless of the authentication repository). The credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note :__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

#### 3. Removal of an owner

* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
- This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are performed securely and in line with best practices for access management.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __configuration of the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can use the Shiva console's local authentication repository or integrate your organization with one of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- OpenID Connect compatible repositories,
- SAML compatible repositories,
- Microsoft ADFS
- Microsoft Entra ID (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- Keycloak

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents __the contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It holds all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for your Cloud architecture.

User roles (rights/permissions) are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in a tenant, but not in another.

### Resetting the Two-Factor Authentication

This action is available only for a local account (non SSO).

Select in your __'Profile'__, top right of the screen then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one initiating the request to reset your two-factor authentication. Please report any requests not coming from you via a support ticket.

### Change the language of a user

Changing the language of a user is done in their __'Profile'__, top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

The configuration is done per tenant [Tenant](#tenants).

### Creating a User Account in Your Organization

The creation of a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user into an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen on the green bar, then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the users page.

<img src={shivaOnboard_003} />

Enter the user's email address next.

<img src={shivaOnboard_004} />

The user will then receive a verification email.

<img src={shivaOnboard_001} />

Once the verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Managing Owners on a Tenant

Each tenant has at least one owner, ensuring clear responsibility and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to declare multiple owners on the same tenant, enabling collaboration and shared decision-making. Below, you will find important information to consider when managing these owners.

## Tenant

A tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has at least one tenant (called the __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Usually, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical scopes.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Preproduction__ tenant
- A __Testing__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

It is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- A __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__ tenant
- A __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__ tenant
- ...

Technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and its associated L2 networks are only available in one tenant. Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is usually addressed in an initial workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, i.e., a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A VLAN network.

| Order reference                                        | Unit    | SKU                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of a tenant           | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of an availability zone | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |

### Access Authorization for a Tenant: Allowed IP Addresses

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses, in compliance with the requirements of the SecNumCloud qualification. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an authorized IP is done via a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Thematic Notifications Subscription

The subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes, which will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My Subscriptions" tab:

<img src={shivaProfil_007} />

For example, in case of an incident, specific email notifications related to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and will gradually expand to meet evolving needs and changes in our operational environment.

#### Important Information on the Management of Owners

#### 1. Number of Owners

* There is no technical limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
- The management interface (GUI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, in order to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.

### Resource consumption within a tenant

It is possible to visualize the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of the deployed services. This feature allows users to monitor resource consumption in real time, identify the most heavily used services, and optimize their usage according to their needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" and select the desired time period. You will then be able to view detailed cloud resource consumption over the defined period, enabling you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:

<img src={shivaTenantRessources_01} />

### Re-registration of a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not validated their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is then possible to send them a link to renew their initial registration.

The re-registration of a user must be performed in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to re-register, then click on the action button at the end of the line then __'Re-registration'__.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the originator of the re-registration request for your user account. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_012} />

### Assigning Permissions to a User

User rights management is done from the user page.

<img src={shivaOnboard_003} />

By default, a user has no rights. Therefore, the administrator who sent the invitation must grant the necessary rights for their activity. Simply click on the __'Actions'__ menu of the user and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

<img src={shivaOnboard_005} />

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions is accessible [here](#permissions).

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows for fine-grained management of user rights, with tenant-based segregation.  
Initially, it is the main account of the client that enables the initial configuration of accounts and their associated permissions.  
Subsequently, the right __'iam_write'__ allows an account to manage the permissions of other users.

### Password Reset

This action is available only for a local account (non-SSO).

Select in your __'Profile'__, top right of the screen then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset Password'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one who initiated the request. Please report any requests not coming from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_015} />

### Update your profile

This action is only available for a local account (not SSO).

Select in your __'Profile'__, top right of the screen then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Update your profile'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one who initiated the profile update request. Please report any requests not coming from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_014} />

#### 2. Adding a new owner

* When adding a new owner, the update of their permissions may require a delay of up to 60 minutes.
- This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.

### Available permissions for users in your organization

When a user is created, they have no default permissions. Each permission is assigned individually and works in a unitary way, without overlapping with other permissions. They are applied in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and each tenant in your organization:
 • "read" type permissions: allow only the consultation of resources without the possibility of modification.
 • "write" type permissions: authorize the modification of configurations.
  • "management" type permissions: authorize advanced management of resources.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ For this reason, it is necessary to have READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.
