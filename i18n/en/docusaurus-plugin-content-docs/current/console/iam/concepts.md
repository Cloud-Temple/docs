## Utilisateurs

User accounts for the Shiva console are created by the master account of the client upon invitation (regardless of the authentication repository). Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

User accounts within your organization are created via invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](#organisations), navigate to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen in the green banner, then go to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click the __'New User'__ button on the users' page.

Then enter the user's email address

![](images/shiva_onboard_004.png)

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user's page.

![](images/shiva_onboard_003.png)

By default, a user has no rights. Therefore, the administrator who sent the invitation must grant the necessary rights for the user's activity. Simply click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

The permissions configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions are accessible [here](#permissions).

### Re-registering a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not validated their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is then possible to resend a link for the user to renew their initial registration.

Re-registering a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-register, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Re-register'__.

**Warning**: Make sure that the re-registration request for your user account originates from you. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Updating your profile

This action is only available for a local (non-SSO) account.

Select __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the __'Update your profile'__ action.

Then check your email box and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

**Warning**: Make sure that the profile update request originates from you. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting your password

This action is only available for a local (non-SSO) account.

Select __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the __'Reset Password'__ action.

Then check your email box and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

**Warning**: Make sure that the password reset request originates from you. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting Two-Factor Authentication

This action is only available for a local (non-SSO) account.

Select __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the __'Reset MFA'__ action.

Then check your email box and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

**Warning**: Make sure that the request to reset your two-factor authentication originates from you. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Delete'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_013.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_010.png)

Note: You cannot delete yourself, and you cannot delete an __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out of a user is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'Logout'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_009.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_011.png)

An automatic logout is done when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing the language of a user

Changing the language for a user is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_006.png)

The configuration is done for each [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscribing to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes, which will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, under the "My subscriptions" tab:

![](images/shiva_profil_007.png)

For example, in the event of an incident, specific email notifications related to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and will be progressively enriched to adapt to needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows fine-grained management of user rights in an organization, with segregation by tenant. Initially, it is the main client's account that enables the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions. Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer other users' permissions.

### Permissions available for users in your organization

The following permissions can be configured for each [user](#utilisateurs) and for each [tenant](#tenants#selection-dun-tenant) in your organization.

Permissions available for users in your organization

When a user is created, they possess no permissions by default. Each permission is granted individually and operates independently, without overlapping with other permissions. They apply in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions can be configured for each user and for each tenant in your organization:
	•	"Read" type permissions: grant access to view resources without the ability to modify them.
	•	"Write" type permissions: authorize configuration modifications.
	•	"Management" type permissions: authorize advanced resource management.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ Therefore, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permission to modify a configuration.

**Notes** :

- *There is no limit to the number of owners that can be defined for the tenant. However, the management interface (GUI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security reasons and optimal access management.*
- *When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes. This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.*
- *To remove a tenant owner, the user must submit a request to support. This procedure ensures that access rights changes are made securely and in accordance with best access management practices.*

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your __sponsoring account__ and the __associated Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, ...) that holds the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents __the contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It holds all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Pre-production, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for your Cloud architecture needs.

The roles (rights/permissions) of users are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __configuration of the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can
use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or hook your organization to one
of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- __OpenID Connect__ compatible repositories,
- __SAML__ compatible repositories,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak


## Tenant

The tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organizations) has at least one tenant (called __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Usually, several tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical scopes.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Pre-production__ tenant
- A __Testing__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- An __Application 1__ tenant or __Criticality 1__
- An __Application 2__ tenant or __Criticality 2__
- ...

The technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a hypervisor cluster and the associated L2 networks are only available in one tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is usually addressed in the initial workshop when the organization is created.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, i.e., a physical data center),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.


| Order reference                                              | Unit    | SKU                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of a tenant                 | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of an availability zone | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |


### Tenant access authorization: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to pre-authorized IP addresses, in accordance with the requirements of SecNumCloud qualification. This restriction ensures a high level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risks of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an authorized IP is done through a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Consumption of resources within a tenant

It is possible to view the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of the various deployed services. This feature allows users to monitor in real-time their resource consumption, identify the most heavily utilized services, and optimize their usage according to needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" and then select the desired time period. You will then be able to see detailed cloud resource consumption over the defined period, allowing you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
