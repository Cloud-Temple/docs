## Users

Access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the sponsor's master account by invitation (regardless of the authentication repository). Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Nota:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen on the green ribbon and then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the users' page.

Then enter the user's email address

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once the verification is complete, the user can log in to the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user page.

![](images/shiva_onboard_003.png)

By default, a user has no rights. It is therefore necessary for the administrator who sent the invitation to grant the user the necessary rights for their activity. Just click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) within the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions is accessible [here](#permissions).

### Re-enrolling a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not confirmed their registration within the expiration time of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is possible to resend them a link so they can renew their initial registration.

Re-enrolling a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-enroll, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Re-enroll'__.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the user account re-enrollment request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Updating your profile

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Update Your Profile'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the profile update request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Password reset

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset Password'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the password reset request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting multifactor authentication

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your multifactor authentication.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the multifactor authentication reset request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Delete'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_013.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_010.png)

Note: You cannot delete yourself, nor can you delete a __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out a user is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'Logout'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_009.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_011.png)

An automatic logout is performed when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing a user's language

To change a user's language, go to their __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_006.png)

The configuration is done for each [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscriptions to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes, which will automatically be sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My Subscriptions" tab:

![](images/shiva_profil_007.png)

For example, in the event of an incident, specific email notifications for this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is likely to evolve and gradually expand to adapt to needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant. Initially, it is the sponsor's main account that allows for the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions. Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer other users' permissions.

### Available permissions for users in your organization

When a user is created, they do not have any default permissions. Each permission is granted individually and operates unitarily without overlapping with other permissions. They apply in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions can be configured for each user and for each tenant in your organization:
	•	“Read” type permissions: allow only consultation of resources without modification.
	•	“Write” type permissions: authorize the modification of configurations.
 	•	“Management“ type permissions: authorize advanced management of resources.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.

## Organizations
L'organisation est liée à votre __compte commanditaire__ et au __contrat Cloud Temple associé__. Elle représente votre entité (société, département, équipe, etc.) qui porte la relation contractuelle entre Cloud Temple et vous.

### Organization Principle

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local to the Shiva console or remote via an identity federation service,
- It carries all the __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, etc.) that you define for the needs of your Cloud architecture.

The roles (rights/permissions) of users are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account may be allowed to order resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __authentication mechanism configuration__ at the organization level. You can
use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or link your organization to one of
your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- __OpenID Connect__ compliant repositories,
- __SAML__ compliant repositories,
- __Microsoft ADFS__,
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory),
- Amazon AWS Cognito,
- Okta,
- Auth0,
- KeyCloak.

## Tenant

A tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has at least one tenant (called __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Generally, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical scopes.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant,
- A __Preproduction__ tenant,
- A __Staging__ tenant,
- A __Qualification__ tenant.

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- An __Application 1__ tenant or __Criticality 1__,
- An __Application 2__ tenant or __Criticality 2__,
- ...

The technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and the associated L2 networks are available only in one tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions are to be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization should carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is generally discussed in the initial workshop when creating the organization.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or deleting tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, a physical data center),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.

| Order Reference| Unit    | SKU                  |
|-----------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Tenant activation | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1 |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Availability zone activation | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |

### Tenant Owners Management

#### Context
Each tenant has at least one owner, thus ensuring clear responsibility and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to declare multiple owners for a single tenant, enabling collaboration and shared decision-making. Below you will find important information to consider when managing these owners.

#### Important Information on Owner Management

#### 1. Number of Owners
* There is no technical limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
* The management interface (UI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, encouraging a limit on the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.

#### 2. Adding a New Owner
* When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes.
* This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.

#### 3. Removing an Owner
* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
* This procedure ensures that access rights changes are made securely and in compliance with best access management practices.

### Tenant Access Authorization: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses in accordance with SecNumCloud qualification requirements. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thus minimizing the risks of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an authorized IP is done by submitting a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource Consumption within a Tenant

It is possible to view the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of the various deployed services. This feature allows users to monitor their resource consumption in real-time, identify the most used services, and optimize their usage according to their needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" then select the desired time period. You will then be able to view in detail the cloud resource consumption for the defined period, which will allow you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
