## Utilisateurs

The access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the client's master account upon invitation (regardless of the authentication directory).
The credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

The creation of a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user to an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left of your screen on the green banner, then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the users' page.

Then indicate the user's email address.

![](images/shiva_onboard_004.png)

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once verification is complete, the user can log into the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user page.

![](images/shiva_onboard_003.png)

By default, a user has no rights. It is therefore necessary for the administrator who invited them to grant the rights needed for their activity. Simply click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu will then appear:

The configuration of permissions must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions can be accessed [here](#permissions).

### Re-enrolling a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not validated their registration within the email expiration period sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is then possible to resend them a link so they can renew their initial registration.

Re-enrolling a user is to be done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-enroll, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Re-enroll'__.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the one requesting the re-enrollment of your user account. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

Select your __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Update your Profile'__.

Then go to your mailbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the one requesting the profile update. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

![](images/shiva_profil_010.png)

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out a user is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'Log Out'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_011.png)

An automatic logout occurs when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing a user's language

Changing a user's language is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_006.png)

The configuration is done for each [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscribing to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to the activated themes that will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My subscriptions" tab:

![](images/shiva_profil_007.png)

For example, in case of an incident, specific email notifications for this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is likely to evolve and gradually expand to adapt to the needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the client's main account that allows the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to administer other users' permissions.

### Permissions available for users in your organization

When a user is created, they have no permissions by default. Each permission is individually assigned and operates on a unitary basis, without overlapping with other permissions. They apply in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and for each tenant in your organization:
   •	“read” type permissions: allow only resource consultation without modification capability.
   •	“write” type permissions: allow configuration modifications.
   •	“management” type permissions: allow advanced resource management.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, it is necessary to have READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.

**Notes** :

- *There is no limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant. However, the management interface (UI) will issue a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.*
- *When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes. This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are properly applied to all associated services and resources.*
- *To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a support request. This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are carried out securely and in accordance with best access management practices.*

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your __sponsoring account__ and the associated __Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, ...) that carries the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global authentication mechanism configuration__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It carries all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for the needs of your Cloud architecture.

User roles (rights/permissions) are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication mechanisms

At the organization level, the Shiva console allows __the configuration of the authentication mechanism__. You can use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or dock your organization to one of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- __OpenID Connect__ compatible repositories,
- __SAML__ compatible repositories,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak


## Tenant

The tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organizations) has at least one tenant (called __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Generally, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical perimeters.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Preproduction__ tenant
- A __Test__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- An __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__ tenant
- An __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__ tenant
- ...

The ordered technical resources are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and associated L2 networks are available only in 1 tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions are to be defined in each tenant. Therefore, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is generally addressed in an initial workshop, at the time of the organization's creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.


| Order Reference                                             | Unit     | SKU                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Tenant activation                     | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of an availability zone    | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |


### Access authorization to a tenant: Allowed IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to pre-authorized IP addresses, in compliance with SecNumCloud qualification requirements. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by only allowing access to users from specified IP ranges, thus minimizing unauthorized access risks and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an allowed IP is done through a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource consumption within a tenant

It is possible to view the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of various deployed services. This feature allows users to monitor their resource consumption in real-time, identify the most utilized services, and optimize their usage according to needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" then select the desired time period. You can then view in detail the consumption of cloud resources over the defined period, which will allow you to analyze the use of services and optimize your management accordingly:
