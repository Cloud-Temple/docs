## Users

User accounts for Shiva console access are created by the master account of the contractor upon invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).
Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user in an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen on the green banner and then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the user page.

Then, enter the user's email address

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once the verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the user page.

![](images/shiva_onboard_003.png)

By default, a user has no rights. Therefore, the administrator who sent the invitation must grant them the necessary rights for their activity. Just click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu will then appear:

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definition is accessible [here](#permissions).

### Re-registering a user

When a user has been provisioned but did not validate their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their registration. It is then possible to re-send them a link to renew their initial registration.

User re-registration is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to re-register, then click on the action button at the end of the line, then __'Re-register'__.

**Warning**: Make sure you are genuinely the one requesting the re-registration of your user account. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Updating your profile

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__, and select the action __'Update your profile'__.

Then go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

**Warning**: Make sure you are genuinely the one requesting the profile update. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting your password

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__, and select the action __'Reset Password'__.

Then go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

**Warning**: Make sure you are genuinely the one requesting the password reset. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting multifactor authentication

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__, and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Then go to your email inbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your multifactor authentication.

**Warning**: Make sure you are genuinely the one requesting the multifactor authentication reset. Please report any request that does not come from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user is done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line, then __'Delete'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_010.png)

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out a user is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'Logout'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_011.png)

An automatic logout is done when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing a user's language

Changing a user's language is done in their __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_006.png)

The configuration is done for each [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscribing to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes that will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My subscriptions" tab:

![](images/shiva_profil_007.png)

 For example, in case of an incident, specific email notifications for this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and will gradually expand to adapt to our operational environment's needs and changes.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows for fine-grained user rights management within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the main account of the contractor that allows the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Thereafter, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to manage the permissions of other users.

### Permissions available for users in your organization

When a user is created, they do not have any permissions by default. Each permission is individually assigned and operates on a unitary basis, without overlapping with other permissions. They apply in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and for each tenant of your organization:
    • "read" type permissions: allow only viewing resources without modification.
    • "write" type permissions: authorize configuration modifications.
    • "management" type permissions: authorize advanced resource management.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ As such, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.

## Organisations

The organization is linked to your __sponsoring account__ and the __associated Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, ...) that carries the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for monitoring and billing purposes,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It carries all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for your Cloud architecture needs.

The roles (rights/permissions) of users are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication mechanisms

The Shiva console allows at the organization level __the configuration of the authentication mechanism__. You can
use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or you can dock your organization to one
of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- Repositories compatible with __OpenID Connect__,
- Repositories compatible with __SAML__,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak

## Tenant

The tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has at least one tenant (called __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Generally, several tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical scopes.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Preproduction__ tenant
- A __Testing__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- A tenant __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__
- A tenant __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__
- ...

The ordered technical resources are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and the associated L2 networks are only available in 1 tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is generally addressed in an initialization workshop, at the time of the organization's creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, i.e., a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network vlan.

|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of a tenant                 | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of an availability zone     | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |


### Managing owners on a tenant
Each tenant has at least one owner, thus ensuring clear responsibility and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to declare multiple owners on the same tenant, allowing for collaboration and shared decision-making. Below, you will find important information to consider when managing these owners.

#### Important information on owner management

#### 1. Number of owners
* There is no technical limit to the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
* The management interface (IHM) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security reasons and optimal access management.

#### 2. Adding a new owner
* When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes.
* This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.

#### 2. Owner permissions
* An owner will be assigned all permissions related to the products activated on their tenant.
* It is not possible to modify an owner's permissions.

#### 3. Removing an owner
* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
* This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are performed securely and in accordance with access management best practices.

### Tenant access authorization: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses, in compliance with SecNumCloud qualification requirements. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thus minimizing the risks of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *Removing an authorized IP is done through a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource consumption within a tenant

It is possible to visualize the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, thus offering a detailed view of the usage of the various deployed services. This functionality allows users to track their resource consumption in real-time, identify the most solicited services, and optimize their usage according to needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" and then select the desired time period. You will thus be able to visualize in detail the consumption of cloud resources over the defined period, which will allow you to analyze the usage of services and optimize your management accordingly:
