## Utilisateurs

The access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the master account of the client upon invitation (regardless of the authentication directory).
The credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note:__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user in an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left of your screen on the green band and then in the __'Users'__ sub-menu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the users page.

Then enter the user's email address.

The user will then receive a verification email.

Once verification is completed, the user will be able to log into the console.

### Assigning permissions to a user

User rights management is done from the users page.

![](images/shiva_onboard_003.png)

By default, a user has no rights. It is therefore necessary for the administrator who sent the invitation to grant the user the rights needed for their activity. Simply click on the user's __'Actions'__ menu and choose the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions can be accessed [here](#permissions).

### Re-enrolling a user

When a user has been provisioned but has not validated their enrollment within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they can no longer confirm their enrollment. It is then possible to resend them a link so they can renew their initial enrollment.

Re-enrollment of a user is done in the Administration panel, under the __'User'__ tab at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-enroll, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Re-enrollment'__.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the re-enrollment request for your user account. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Updating your profile

This action is available only for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Update your profile'__.

Then go to your mailbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the profile update request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting the password

This action is available only for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Reset password'__.

Then go to your mailbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the password reset request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Resetting two-factor authentication

This action is available only for a local account (non-SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'User settings'__ and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Then go to your mailbox and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

**Warning**: Make sure you are the originator of the two-factor authentication reset request. Please report any requests that do not come from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user is done in the Administration panel, under the __'User'__ tab at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line and then __'Delete'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_013.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_010.png)

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a __'Owner'__ user.

### Logging out

Logging out a user is done from their __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, then __'Logout'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_009.png)
![](images/shiva_profil_011.png)

An automatic logout occurs when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing a user's language

Changing a user's language is done from their __'Profile'__ at the top right of the screen, in the __'User settings'__.

![](images/shiva_profil_006.png)

The configuration is done for each tenant [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscribing to thematic notifications

Subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes that will be automatically sent when corresponding events occur.

It is accessible in the user profile, under the "My Subscriptions" tab:

![](images/shiva_profil_007.png)

 For example, in case of an incident, email notifications specific to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes may evolve and gradually expand to adapt to needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the main client account that allows the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the __'iam_write'__ right allows an account to manage the permissions of other users.

### Available permissions for users in your organization

When a user is created, they do not have any permissions by default. Each permission is assigned individually and works separately from other permissions. They apply together, meaning that a user must have all the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and for each tenant within your organization:
	•	“Read” type permissions: allow viewing resources without any modification.
	•	“Write” type permissions: allow modifying configurations.
 	•	“Management” type permissions: allow advanced management of resources.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ Therefore, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permission to modify a configuration.

- *There is no limit on the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant. However, the management interface (GUI) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.*
- *When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes. This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are properly applied to all associated services and resources.*
- *To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support. This procedure ensures that access rights changes are made securely and in accordance with best practices for access management.*

## Organisations

The organization is linked to your __sponsor account__ and the associated __Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, etc.) that carries the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an organization

The organization has four major roles:

- It represents __the contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines __the global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It carries all the __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, etc.) that you define for the needs of your Cloud architecture.

The roles (rights/permissions) of users are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account may be authorized to order resources in one tenant, but not in another.

### Authentication mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __the configuration of the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can
use the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or connect your organization to one
of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- __OpenID Connect__ compatible repositories,
- __SAML__ compatible repositories,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak


## Tenant

The tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has a minimum of one tenant (called __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Typically, several tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical perimeters.

For example:

- A tenant __Production__
- A tenant __Preproduction__
- A tenant __Staging__
- A tenant __Qualification__

But it is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- A tenant __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__
- A tenant __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__
- ...

The technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and the associated L2 networks are available only in 1 tenant.
Regarding networks, it is possible to request __'cross tenant'__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions are to be defined in each tenant. Therefore, each organization must carefully consider the tenants desired. This point is usually addressed in an initialization workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- An availability zone (AZ, a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.


| Order Reference                                             | Unit     | SKU                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Tenant activation                      | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Availability zone activation           | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |


### Tenant access authorization: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to pre-authorized IP addresses, in accordance with SecNumCloud qualification requirements. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thus minimizing the risks of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *Removal of an authorized IP is done via a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource consumption within a tenant

It is possible to view the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, thus providing a detailed view of the usage of the various deployed services. This feature allows users to monitor their resource consumption in real time, identify the most utilized services, and optimize their use based on needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" then select the desired time period. You can then view in detail the consumption of cloud resources over the defined period, which will allow you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
