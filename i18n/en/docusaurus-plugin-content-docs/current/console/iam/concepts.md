## Users

Access accounts to the Shiva console are created by the client's master account via invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).
Credentials are global to your [Organization](#organisations).

*__Note :__ [Identity federation is managed at the organization level](#organisations#mecanismes-dauthentification)*

### Creating a user account in your organization

Creating a user account in your organization is done by invitation. To invite a user into an [Organization](#organisations), go to the __'Administration'__ menu on the left side of your screen on the green bar, then to the __'Users'__ submenu.

Click the __'New User'__ button from the users page.

Enter the user's email address next

<img src={shivaOnboard_004} />

The user will then receive a verification email.

<img src={shivaOnboard_001} />

Once the verification is complete, the user will be able to log in to the console.

### Assigning Permissions to a User

User rights management is done from the user page.

<img src={shivaOnboard_003} />

By default, a user has no rights. Therefore, the administrator who sent the invitation must grant the necessary rights for their activity. Simply click on the __'Actions'__ menu of the user and select the __'Edit'__ option.

The rights activation menu then appears:

<img src={shivaOnboard_005} />

Permission configuration must be done for each [Tenant](#tenants) of the [Organization](#organisations).

The list of permissions and their definitions is available [here](#permissions).

### Re-enrollment of a user

When a user has been provisioned but did not validate their registration within the email's expiration period, they can no longer confirm their sign-up. It is then possible to send them a link to renew their initial registration.

Re-enrolling a user must be done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to re-enroll, then click on the action button at the end of the line and __'Re-enrollment'__.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one initiating the re-enrollment request. Please report any requests not coming from you via a support ticket.

### Update your profile

This action is only available for a local account (non-SSO).

Select in your __'Profile'__, top right of the screen then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Update your profile'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your profile.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one who initiated the profile update request. Please report any requests not originating from you via a support ticket.

### Password Reset

This action is available only for a local account (non SSO).

Select in your __'Profile'__, top right of the screen then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset Password'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Simply follow the steps to update your password.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one who initiated the password reset request. Please report any requests not originating from you via a support ticket.

<img src={shivaProfil_015} />

### Resetting the Two-Factor Authentication

This action is available only for a local account (non SSO).

Select your __'Profile'__, at the top right of the screen, then __'User Settings'__ and select the action __'Reset MFA'__.

Then go to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

__Warning__: Make sure you are the one initiating the request to reset your two-factor authentication. Please report any requests not coming from you via a support ticket.

### Deleting a user

Deleting a user must be done in the __'User'__ tab of the Administration panel, at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you want to delete, then click on the action button at the end of the line, then __'Delete'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_013} />
<img src={shivaProfil_010} />

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a user __'Owner'__.

### Log out

Logging out a user is done in their __'Profile'__, top right of the screen, then __'Log out'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_009} />
<img src={shivaProfil_011} />

An automatic logout occurs when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Change the language of a user

Changing the language of a user must be done in their __'Profile'__, top right of the screen, in the __'User Settings'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

The configuration is set for each tenant [Tenant](#tenants).

### Subscription to Thematic Notifications

The subscription management allows you to receive emails related to activated themes, which will be automatically sent upon the occurrence of corresponding events.

It is accessible in the user profile, in the "My Subscriptions" tab:

<img src={shivaProfil_007} />

For example, in case of an incident, specific email notifications related to this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and will gradually expand to adapt to needs and changes in our operational environment.

## Permissions

The Shiva console allows for fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with segregation by tenant.
Initially, it is the main account of the client that allows the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions.
Subsequently, the right **'iam_write'** allows an account to manage the permissions of other users.

### Available permissions for users in your organization

When a user is created, they have no default permissions. Each permission is assigned individually and works in isolation, without overlapping with other permissions. They are applied in conjunction, meaning a user must have all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions are configurable for each user and each tenant in your organization:

- "read" type permissions: allow only the viewing of resources without the possibility of modification.
- "write" type permissions: allow modification of configurations.
- "management" type permissions: allow advanced management of resources.
- "console_access" type permissions: allow PMAD-type connections to resources.
- "virtual_machine_power" type permissions: allow management of a virtual machine's power.

- __These are permissions, not roles.__ For this reason, it is necessary to have both READ and WRITE permissions to modify a configuration.

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your __sponsor account__ and the __associated Cloud Temple contract__. It represents your entity (company, department, team, ...) that holds the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and you.

### Principle of an Organization

The organization has four main roles:

- It represents the __contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines the __global configuration of the authentication mechanism__: authentication can be local at the Shiva console level or remote via an identity federation service,
- It hosts all __user accounts__,
- It __federates the tenants__ (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, ...) that you define for your Cloud architecture.

User roles (rights/permissions) are configurable for each tenant defined in your organization. For example, an account can be authorized to order resources in one tenant but not in another.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The Shiva console allows __configuration of the authentication mechanism__ at the organization level. You can use the Shiva console's local authentication repository or integrate your organization with one of your authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- Repositories compatible with __OpenID Connect__,
- Repositories compatible with __SAML__,
- __Microsoft ADFS__
- __Microsoft EntraID__ (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak

## Tenant

A tenant is a __grouping of resources within an organization__. An [Organization](#organisations) has at least one tenant (called the __default tenant__, which can be renamed). Usually, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical scopes.

For example:

- A __Production__ tenant
- A __Preproduction__ tenant
- A __Testing__ tenant
- A __Qualification__ tenant

It is also possible to organize things with an __application view__ or by __criticality__:

- A __Application 1__ or __Criticality 1__ tenant
- A __Application 2__ or __Criticality 2__ tenant
- ...

Technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For example, a Hypervisor cluster and its associated L2 networks are only available in 1 tenant. Regarding networks, it is possible to request __cross-tenant__ networks to ensure network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, each organization must carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is usually addressed in an initial workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It is possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty. It must necessarily be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- A zone of availability (AZ, i.e., a physical datacenter),
- A compute cluster,
- A storage space,
- A network VLAN.

| Order Reference                                        | Unit    | SKU                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------|
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of a tenant           | 1 tenant | csp:tenant:v1           |
| TENANT - *(REGION)* - Activation of a zone of availability | 1 tenant | csp:(region):iaas:az:v1 |

### Managing Owners on a Tenant

Each tenant has at least one owner, ensuring clear responsibility and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, it is possible to declare multiple owners on the same tenant, enabling collaboration and shared decision-making. Below, you will find important information to consider when managing these owners.

#### Important Information on Owner Management

#### 1. Number of Owners

* There is no technical limit regarding the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
- The management interface (IHM) issues a warning when there are more than 3 owners, to encourage limiting the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.

#### 2. Adding a new owner

* When adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes.
- This propagation time is normal and ensures that access rights are correctly applied to all associated services and resources.

#### 2. Owner permissions

* An owner will be assigned all permissions related to the products activated on their tenant.
- It is not possible to modify an owner's permissions.

#### 3. Removal of an owner

* To remove an owner from the tenant, the user must submit a request to support.
- This procedure ensures that access rights modifications are performed securely and in line with best practices for access management.

### Access Authorization for a Tenant: Authorized IPs

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to previously authorized IP addresses, in compliance with the requirements of the SecNumCloud qualification. This restriction ensures an enhanced level of security by allowing access only to users from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and protecting the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *The removal of an authorized IP is done via a support request in the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource Consumption within a Tenant

It is possible to visualize the cloud resources consumed within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of the different deployed services. This feature allows users to track their resource consumption in real-time, identify the most requested services, and optimize their usage according to their needs.

In the console menu, click on "Consumption Report" and select the desired time period. You will be able to visualize in detail the cloud resource consumption over the defined period, which will allow you to analyze service usage and optimize your management accordingly:
