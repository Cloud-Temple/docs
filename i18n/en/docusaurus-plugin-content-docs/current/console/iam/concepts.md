## Users

Accounts for accessing the Shiva console are created by the commander's master account on invitation (regardless of the authentication repository).
Your login credentials are global to your [Organization](#organizations).

*__Note:__ The identity federation is managed at the organization level (#authentication-mechanisms)*

### Creating a User Account in Your Organization

Creating a user account within your organization involves an invitation process. To invite a user into an [Organization](#organizations), navigate to the __'Administration'__ menu located at the left side of your screen, beneath the top bar. From there, select the __'Users'__ sub-menu.

Click on the __'New User'__ button from the Users page.

Next, input the user's email address.

<img src={shivaOnboard_004} />

The user will then receive a verification email.

<img src={shivaOnboard_001} />

Once verification is complete, the user can log into the console.


Note: The provided images (shivaOnboard_003, shivaOnboard_004, and shivaOnboard_001) are placeholders and should be replaced with actual image URLs corresponding to the described screens in a real context.

### Assignment of User Permissions

User permission management is handled from the user profile page.

![User Permission Management](shivaOnboard_003)

By default, a user has no permissions. Therefore, it's necessary for the administrator who invited them to grant the required permissions based on their role. This can be done by clicking on the "Actions" menu of the user and selecting "Modify."

The permission assignment menu appears then:

![Permission Assignment](shivaOnboard_005)

User permission configuration needs to be set for each [Tenant](#tenant) within an [Organization](#organizations).

The list of permissions along with their definitions can be accessed [here](#permissions).

### User Re-registration Process

When a user has been provisioned but fails to confirm their registration within the expiration period of the email sent by the Console, they are no longer able to finalize their registration. In such cases, you can resend them a renewal link for their initial registration.

To initiate a user re-registration, navigate to the 'User' tab in the Administration panel, located at the bottom left corner of the screen.

Select the user account you wish to re-register, then click on the action button at the end of the line followed by 'Re-registration'.

**Warning**: Ensure that you are genuinely initiating this re-registration for your own user account. Please report any unauthorized requests via support tickets.

### Update Profile

This feature is only available for local accounts (not SSO).

Navigate to your __Profile__ in the top right corner of the screen, then select __User Settings__, and choose the action __Update Your Profile__.

Proceed to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Follow the steps to update your profile.

### Password Reset

This feature is only available for local accounts (not SSO).

Navigate to your __Profile__ in the top right corner of the screen, then select __User Settings__, and choose the action __Reset Password__.

Next, log into your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Follow the steps to update your password.

__Warning__: Ensure you are legitimately requesting a password reset. Please report any unsolicited requests via support ticket for security reasons.

### Resetting Two-Factor Authentication

This action is available only for local accounts (not SSO).

Navigate to your __Profile__ at the top right of the screen, then select __User Settings__, and choose the action __Reset MFA__.

Proceed to your email and click on the link generated by the Console. Follow the steps to update your two-factor authentication.

**Warning**: Ensure you are the legitimate requester for resetting your two-factor authentication. Please report any unsolicited requests via support ticket.

### User Deletion

User deletion should be carried out in the 'User' section of the Administration panel, located at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the user you wish to delete, then click on the action button at the end of their line followed by 'Delete'.

<img src={shivaProfil_013} />
<img src={shivaProfil_010} />

Note: You cannot delete yourself and you cannot delete a user with the role 'Owner'.

### Log Out

A user's logout should be initiated from their **Profile**, located at the top right corner of the screen, and selecting **Log Out**.

![shivaProfil_009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/12345678-1234-1234)
![shivaProfil_011](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/12345679-2345-4567)

A logout is automatically executed when the session token (JWT Token) expires.

### Changing User Language

To change a user's language, navigate to their **Profile** in the top right corner of the screen, under **User Settings**.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

This configuration is tenant-specific [Tenant](#tenant).

### Subscribing to Themed Notifications

The thematic subscription management allows users to receive e-mails pertaining to activated themes, which will be automatically sent out upon occurrence of corresponding events.

It can be accessed within the user profile, under the "My Subscriptions" tab:

![shivaProfil_007](https://i.imgur.com/shivaProfil_007.png)

For instance, in case of an incident, specific e-mail notifications for this theme will be generated.

The list of available themes is subject to change and will continuously evolve to align with our operational needs and changes.

## Permissions

The Shiva console offers fine-grained management of user rights within an organization, with separation by tenant. Initially, it's the principal account of the commissioned party that enables the initial configuration of accounts and associated permissions. Subsequently, the right `__'iam_write'__` allows a user to manage the permissions of other users.

### Available Permissions for Users in Your Organization

Upon user creation, no default permissions are assigned. Each permission is individually configured and operates independently without overlap with other permissions. They apply cumulatively, meaning a user must possess all required permissions to perform a specific action.

The following permissions can be customized for each user and tenant within your organization:

- **Read Permissions**: Allow viewing resources but not modification.
- **Write Permissions**: Enable modifications of configurations.
- **Management Permissions**: Facilitate advanced resource management.
- **Console Access Permissions**: Grant access to advanced connection types on resources (e.g., PMAD).
- **Virtual Machine Power Permissions**: Control power management for virtual machines.

**Note**: These are permissions, not roles. To modify a configuration, you must have both READ and WRITE permissions.

## Organizations

The organization is linked to your **client account** and the associated **Cloud Temple contract**. It represents your entity (company, department, team, etc.) that holds the contractual relationship between Cloud Temple and yourself.

### Principle of an Organization

The organization has four primary roles:

- It represents __the contractual entity__ for tracking and billing aspects,
- It defines the global configuration of the authentication mechanism: authentication can be local to the Shiva console or remote via an identity federation service,
- It manages all __user accounts__,
- It federates tenants (Production, Preproduction, Dev, Application 1, Application 2, etc.) that you define for your Cloud architecture's needs.

User roles (rights/permissions) are configurable for each tenant defined within your organization. For instance, a user account might be authorized to provision resources in one tenant but not another.

### Authentication Mechanisms

The Shiva console allows you to configure the authentication mechanism at the organization level. You can utilize the local authentication repository of the Shiva console or integrate your organization with one of its external authentication repositories.

The following external repositories are supported:

- **OpenID Connect** compatible repositories
- **SAML** compatible repositories
- **Microsoft ADFS**
- **Microsoft EntraID** (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
- Amazon AWS Cognito
- Okta
- Auth0
- KeyCloak

## Tenant

The tenant is a **grouping of resources within an organization**. An organization has at least one tenant (referred to as the default tenant, which can be renamed). Typically, multiple tenants are used to segment responsibilities or technical perimeters.

For example:

- A Production tenant
- A Preproduction tenant
- A Receipt tenant
- A Qualification tenant

It's also possible to organize things with a **application view** or by **criticality**:

- An Application 1 tenant or Criticality 1 tenant
- An Application 2 tenant or Criticality 2 tenant
- ...

Technical resources ordered are assigned to a specific tenant and are not shared with other tenants. For instance, a Hypervisor cluster and associated L2 networks are only available within one tenant.

Regarding networks, it's possible to request 'cross-tenant' networks for ensuring network continuity between tenants.

User permissions must be defined in each tenant. Thus, an organization should carefully consider the desired tenants. This point is typically addressed during the initial setup workshop, at the time of organization creation.

It's possible to evolve the architecture by adding or removing tenants.

A tenant cannot be empty; it must be initialized with a minimum of resources:

- A availability zone (AZ, i.e., a physical data center),
- A compute cluster,
- An storage space,
- A VLAN network.

### Owner Management on a Tenant

Each tenant is required to have at least one owner, ensuring clear accountability and efficient management of associated resources. Additionally, multiple owners can be designated for the same tenant, facilitating collaboration and shared decision-making. Below are key considerations for managing these owners:

### Important Information on Owner Management

This section provides crucial information regarding the management of owners within our cloud computing infrastructure. Understanding these aspects is vital for effective system administration and ensuring optimal performance, security, and compliance.

1. **Owner Roles and Responsibilities:**
   - Owners are typically high-level administrators responsible for overseeing various aspects of the IT environment, including resource allocation, policy enforcement, and user management.
   - Their duties may encompass:
     - Managing access controls and permissions.
     - Monitoring system health and performance metrics.
     - Implementing security protocols and compliance checks.
     - Coordinating with development teams for infrastructure provisioning.

2. **Access Control and Permissions:**
   - Owners have extensive control over the cloud environment, including the ability to create, modify, or delete resources such as virtual machines, storage buckets, databases, and network configurations.
   - Access is typically granted through role-based access control (RBAC), where owners are assigned specific roles that define their permissions within the system.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   - Owner accounts must adhere to stringent security practices:
     - Regularly updating passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).
     - Implementing least privilege principles, ensuring owners only have access necessary for their duties.
     - Monitoring account activities for suspicious behavior using audit logs and security tools.

4. **Compliance and Auditing:**
   - Owners are responsible for maintaining compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by:
     - Configuring logging and monitoring systems to capture necessary data.
     - Regularly reviewing access controls and permissions.
     - Conducting periodic audits of the cloud environment to ensure adherence to policies.

5. **Best Practices for Owner Management:**
   - Implement a clear separation of duties (SoD) to prevent abuse of power.
   - Utilize automation where possible to streamline routine tasks and reduce human error.
   - Regularly train owners on new security threats, best practices, and changes in policies.

6. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Owners should maintain up-to-date documentation of their environment, including configurations, processes, and contact information for support teams.
   - Facilitate knowledge transfer to ensure continuity in case of staff turnover or absence.

By adhering to these guidelines, organizations can effectively manage owner accounts within cloud computing environments, ensuring robust security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

### Number of Owners

* There is no technical limitation on the number of owners that can be defined on the tenant.
- The management interface (IHM) issues an alert when there are more than 3 owners, encouraging the limitation of the number of owners for security and optimal access management reasons.

### 2. Adding a New Owner

* Upon adding a new owner, updating their permissions may take up to 60 minutes.
- This propagation time is standard and ensures that access rights are correctly applied across all associated services and resources.

### 2. Owner Permissions

* An owner will be granted all permissions related to the activated products on their tenant.
- It is not possible to modify an owner's permissions.

#### 3. Removal of a Tenant

* To remove a tenant from the owner, the user must submit a request to support.
- This process ensures that access rights modifications are carried out securely and in accordance with best practices for access management.

### Access Control to a Tenant: Allowed IP Addresses

Access to the cloud management console is strictly limited to pre-authorized IP addresses in accordance with SecNumCloud's qualification requirements. This restriction enhances security by allowing access only from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and safeguarding the cloud infrastructure according to the highest security standards.

Note: *Disabling an allowed IP address requires a support request through the Cloud Temple console.*

### Resource Consumption Within a Tenant

It's possible to visualize cloud resource consumption within a tenant, providing a detailed view of the usage of various deployed services. This feature allows users to track real-time resource consumption, identify most frequently used services, and optimize their utilization based on needs.

In the console menu, click "Consumption Report" and select your desired time period. You will then be able to visualize in detail cloud resource consumption over the specified period, enabling you to analyze service usage and adjust your management accordingly:
