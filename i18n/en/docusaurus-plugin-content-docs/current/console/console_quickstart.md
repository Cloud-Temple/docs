Once you have entered the company name, click on __'Sign In'__.

## Language Management

The console is available in __French__ and __English__. You can change the operating language using the __language__ icon located in the top-right corner of the screen.

To change a user's language, go to their __'Profile'__, in the top-right corner of the screen, and select __'User Settings'__.

<img src={shivaProfil_006} />

Configuration is set per tenant [Tenant](iam/concepts.md#tenant).

## Technical Support Access

At any time, you can contact the __Cloud Temple Support Team__ via the __"buoy" icon__ located in the top-right corner of the screen.

<img src={shivaSupport} />

You will be guided through the entire support request process.

The first step is identifying the type of support request:

- Request advice on using a product (non-incident related),
- Request assistance related to your customer account,
- Report an incident or request technical support.
- Request assistance from a professional service (deployment of a Cloud Temple engineer for a specific issue).

<img src={shivaSupport_01} />

You can then provide additional details and attach files (e.g., images or logs).

The requester may also specify a severity level (P1 to P4) in the ticket description, particularly in the case of a security incident, as follows:

__CRITICAL (P1)__:

- Suspected leakage of sensitive data
- Detection of unauthorized access to your data
- Compromise of your administrative credentials
- Complete unavailability of your critical services
- Abnormal behavior on sensitive data
- Breach of personal data

__HIGH (P2)__:

- User access malfunction
- Anomaly in data encryption
- Loss of access to certain critical features
- Data inconsistency
- Major performance degradation impacting operations

__MEDIUM (P3)__:

- Localized performance issue
- Incident affecting a non-critical function
- Configuration error with limited impact
- Temporary access difficulties

__LOW (P4)__:

- Request for investigation
- Anomaly with no direct impact
- Compliance-related question
- Need for technical clarification

## User Feature Access via the Web Interface

All features available to your user (based on their permissions) are located on the left side of the screen, within the green sidebar.  
Features are grouped by module. These primarily include:

- The __inventory__ of your resources,  
- The __tracking of operations__,  
- The __management of IaaS resources__ (Compute, storage, networking, ...),  
- The __management of OpenIaaS resources__ (Compute, storage, networking, ...),  
- Access to __additional services__ (Bastion, monitoring, ...),  
- The __administration of your organization__ (Tenant and permission management, ...).

The activation of a module for a user depends on their user rights. For example, the __'Order'__ module will not be available if the user does not have the __'ORDER'__ permission.

Below is an overview of the available modules. New modules are regularly added to the console:

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
<img src={shivaOnboard_007} style={{'margin-right': 20}}/>
<div>
- __Dashboard__: provides a quick overview of the __total compute and storage resources__, backup __statistics__, and a __summary of support tickets__,
- __Inventory__: offers a view of all your __virtual machines__ resources. If __tags__ are used, it enables filtering by __tag__ (e.g., business view, application view, ...),
- __Managed Services__: provides access to the tracking of your __support requests__ and the __service metrics__,
- __IaaS__: enables the __management of VMware-based IaaS infrastructures__ (Virtual machines, clusters, hypervisors, replication, backup, ...),

- __OpenShift__: enables the management of your **RedHat OpenShift PaaS architecture** and container management across the three availability zones of the platform.
- __Bastion__: allows deployment and management of SSH/RDP bastion appliances within your networks,
- __Networking__: enables management of __Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks__, __public IPs__, and your __telecom circuits__,
