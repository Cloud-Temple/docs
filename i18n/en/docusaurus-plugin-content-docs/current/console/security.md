## Recommendations for Secure Use of Cloud Temple Services

Cloud Temple services provide you with a cloud infrastructure that is secure by design. However, some security best practices remain your responsibility as a user of these services. This guide helps you strengthen the security of your cloud environment by leveraging the features offered in the Console.

You will find practical recommendations to:

- Protect access to the Cloud Console;
- Manage access and permissions in a controlled manner;
- Secure resources deployed through our cloud services.

## Console Access

Access to the Console is the entry point to all your Cloud Temple services. It is therefore essential to protect it effectively.

### Restrict Console Access via IP Filtering

Access to the cloud management console is limited to pre-authorized IP addresses. This restriction ensures that only users from specified IP ranges are granted access, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

You can configure these IP restrictions in your organization settings. To learn how to configure IP filtering, refer to [Access and Authentication Management | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/quickstart?_highlight=*facteur#gestion-des-accès-et-authentification).

To maximize the effectiveness of this mechanism, be sure to:

- **Limit the number of authorized IP addresses** to only what is strictly necessary;
- Avoid overly broad or generic IP ranges;
- Add **only IPs from controlled environments** (e.g., outbound IP of your corporate network);
- Avoid, or minimize, the use of individual IP addresses (e.g., public IP of your IT staff's home);
- Avoid, or minimize, the use of third-party IP addresses (e.g., service provider);
- Keep this list up to date if your network infrastructure changes.

For remote access (e.g., telework, contractors...), favor routing through your corporate network via VPN instead of directly authorizing individual IP addresses. This reduces the Console’s exposure surface and centralizes access management within your organization.

### Use Identity Federation

Identity federation allows you to integrate the Cloud Temple Console with your identity provider (IdP) by enabling SSO. This approach centralizes authentication and offers several benefits:

- Unified account management: creation, modification, and deletion through your directory;
- Reduced attack surface: local accounts become unnecessary or limited;
- Enhanced traceability: access is logged by your IdP;
- Improved integration: MFA, alerting, contextual security policies…;
- Easier compliance: alignment with your internal security practices.

For these reasons, **identity federation is recommended**, especially for large-scale environments or those with high security requirements.

Follow our step-by-step guides to integrate your identity provider:
- [Configure federation with Azure AD | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_aad)
- [Configure federation with ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly strengthens the security of access to the Cloud Temple Console. It adds an extra step to the authentication process by requiring a temporary code generated by a dedicated application in addition to the password. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if credentials are stolen.

For accounts managed locally by the Console (without federation), MFA is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

**For federated accounts, it is strongly recommended to enforce MFA on the identity provider side**, especially for administrators with Console access.

- [Tutorial: Identity Federation with Microsoft ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Access the Console from Secured Devices

The workstation and environment from which you access the Console play an important role in securing the administration of your cloud services. If you operate in a high-security requirements environment, you may apply the following recommendations:

- For management by your own teams, implement some or all of the [Recommendations for Secure IT Administration | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/recommandations-relatives-ladministration-securisee-des-si);
- If management is provided by a third party, consider partnering with an [Administrators and Secure Maintenance Providers (PAMS) | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/prestataires-dadministration-et-de-maintenance-securisees-pams), depending on the sensitivity of hosted resources and your legal or regulatory context.

### Raise Administrator Awareness to Phishing Risks

Access to the Cloud Temple Console requires heightened caution, especially against phishing attempts aimed at stealing credentials or MFA codes. It is crucial that authorized users are regularly trained on these risks: always verify the URL, be cautious with unexpected messages, and report any suspicious activity immediately.

To limit these risks, we recommend never accessing the Console through an email link; instead, always manually enter the usual URL.

These best practices are your responsibility as a client and are essential to prevent phishing attacks. If in doubt, Cloud Temple support is available to help.

## Managing Cloud Services

Your Cloud resources are managed through the Console. This chapter provides essential recommendations for controlling the operation of your cloud services.

### Identify Tenant Owners

The tenant owner holds all permissions related to activated products and receives official notifications. It is critical to ensure that your tenant owners are the appropriate contacts within your organization.

For secure and efficient management:

- **Identify a responsible owner**, preferably someone directly involved in managing the environment.
- **Verify the contact email address** of the owner to ensure it is valid and regularly checked.
- **Maintain direct control**, by adding an owner from your organization, even if you outsource cloud service management, so you can oversee important notifications and decisions.
- **Limit the number of owners** to 3 to reduce exposure and simplify the audit of critical actions.

To learn more about managing tenant owners, refer to the [Guide to Tenant Ownership | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#gestion-des-propri%C3%A9taires-sur-un-tenant).

### Manage Permissions on Your Cloud Services

The Cloud Temple Console allows fine-grained access management by assigning each user one or more permission levels that determine exactly what actions are authorized. Refer to the permissions documentation ([Available Permissions for Organization Users | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#permissions-disponibles-pour-les-utilisateurs-de-votre-organisation)) to understand the different types of permissions and how to assign them properly.

For efficient and secure permission management, we recommend following these best practices:

- **Apply the principle of least privilege:** grant users only the permissions needed for their duties. This reduces risks by limiting access to unnecessary features.
- **Limit sensitive permissions:** Assign sensitive permissions only to users responsible for those functions. Sensitive permissions include access management (console_public_access_write, *_console_access, object-storage_write), permissions management (iam_write, iam_offline_access), and backup management (backup_iaas_opensource_write, backup_iaas_spp_write).**
- **Favor read-only access:** When in doubt, provide read-only access (*_read) to minimize risks while still enabling access to required information.
- **Conduct regular access reviews:** Periodically review user permissions to remove outdated ones. Exporting permissions in CSV format facilitates this process.**

Controlled permission assignment limits risks of error or malicious action and strengthens your security posture.

### Regularly Update Hypervisors

Cloud Temple regularly provides builds for hypervisors to ensure the application of security patches. However, updating hypervisors remains your responsibility, as we do not have visibility into your business constraints.  

Therefore, we recommend that you:
- Regularly check in the Console for the availability of new builds for your hypervisors;  
- **Regularly deploy new builds across all your hypervisors**, especially if they address security vulnerabilities;
- Regularly deploy new versions of vmtools on your virtual machines.

A security information page available in the Console allows you to identify known vulnerabilities and associated recommendations (builds to deploy…).

### Monitor activity on cloud services

To ensure effective monitoring of your cloud environment and respond promptly to anomalies, it is essential to implement an active monitoring strategy. We particularly recommend:

- **Monitoring service availability** via the [Status page | Cloud Temple](https://status.cloud-temple.com/), to be alerted in case of incidents or widespread outages;
- **Enabling relevant topic notifications** for your usage from the Console, to receive important alerts in real time (see [Topic Notifications Subscription | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts#abonnement-aux-notifications-th%C3%A9matiques));
- **Using Cloud activity logs** to identify sensitive or suspicious actions on your resources (see section “Logging - Activity Tracking” of the [Quickstart Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/quickstart)). The collection and analysis of activity logs can be automated using Console APIs, enabling the integration of events into your monitoring or incident detection tools.

## Secure hosted resources

In a Cloud model, the security of deployed resources is the user’s responsibility. Cloud Temple provides a secure infrastructure, but you are responsible for protecting your operating systems, data, and configurations.

Below are essential best practices for strengthening the security of your VMs: backup policy configuration, encryption of critical resources, and hardening of operating systems. These measures help reduce the risk of compromise, ensure data integrity, and maintain business continuity in case of incident.

### Configure backups

To ensure the security and resilience of your data, it is essential to properly define and enforce your backup policies. Assigning a backup policy to each virtual machine before it starts is mandatory. Documentation is available in the "Backup" section of the [Quickstart Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/quickstart).

Here are the recommendations for managing the backup policies of your Cloud Temple resources:

- **Define your backup policies:** Request support to create backup policies tailored to your organization’s security needs.  
- **Avoid suspended policies:** Do not leave any VM associated with a suspended backup policy to avoid compromising data security.
- **Perform restore tests:** Regularly test the restoration of your backups to verify the effectiveness of your restore procedures.

### Encrypt sensitive VMs

In addition to native disk-level encryption for all cloud resources, **VM encryption can be enabled to protect your most sensitive resources**. To do so, consult [Encrypt a VMware virtual machine | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/tutorials/vm_encryption?_highlight=*chiff).

Here are some best practices when using VM encryption:

- Enable encryption on sensitive VMs: Apply it either at machine creation or during a scheduled update. The operation requires a temporary shutdown of the VM;
- Verify encryption status: Check in the console that the VM displays the "encrypted" status;
- Backup before encryption: Ensure the VM is properly backed up before making any changes.

### Restrict the exposure of your resources

To limit the attack surface of your virtual machines, it is strongly recommended to restrict exposed services to the strict minimum. In particular, ensure your resources are configured to **avoid public exposure of administration interfaces and consoles** for deployed systems and applications.

If you use Cloud Temple's Object Storage services, it is also recommended to **avoid configuring your buckets for public access**, except in cases where this is strictly necessary (see [Access limitations for your S3 buckets | Cloud Temple Documentation](../storage/oss/quickstart?_highlight=*bucket#limitations-des-acc%C3%A8s-%C3%A0-vos-bucket-s3)).

### Harden virtual machines (IaaS services)

Hosting a virtual machine on a secure cloud does not, by itself, guarantee the security of the operating system, services, or applications it runs. Hardening VMs, whether deployed by you or from the catalog, is your responsibility.

We recommend you **apply basic security measures**:

- Keep systems up to date with security patches;
- Limit exposed services;
- Disable unnecessary components;  
- Restrict access rights to the bare minimum;
- Enable access logging;
- Configure regular backups.

To guide you in these actions, refer to:

- The hardening guides provided by the software vendors you use;
- [Essential guides and cybersecurity best practices | ANSSI (FR)](https://cyber.gouv.fr/guides-essentiels-et-bonnes-pratiques-de-cybersecurite-par-ou-commencer);
- [CIS Benchmarks® Security Guides | CIS (EN)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

These best practices constitute the first line of defense to secure your systems in the cloud.

### Harden containers (PaaS services)

To ensure the security of your containers as part of the OpenShift PaaS service, we recommend implementing the following measures to strengthen their hardening:

- **Image source**: Ensure that all images come from trusted sources, such as internal registries or the Red Hat Container Catalog, and avoid using unverified community images such as those available on the public Docker Hub.
- **Privilege restriction**: Limit container privileges using OpenShift features, notably *Security Context Constraints* (SCC), to restrict permissions to the bare minimum.
- **SCC configuration**: Create custom SCCs for each application or group of applications. This includes restricting allowed system calls (e.g., via *seccomp profiles*), with specific configurations such as blocking *ptrace* or *mount* to reduce container escape risks.
- **Workload isolation**: Use *Namespaces* and *Network Policies* to isolate applications and limit unnecessary interactions between containers.
- **Comprehensive logging**: Enable logging via the OpenShift Logging operator to capture events related to hosted containers and systems, to better detect and analyze any suspicious activity.
