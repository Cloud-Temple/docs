## Recommendations for Secure Utilization of Cloud Temple Services

Cloud Temple's services provide a highly secure infrastructure by design. However, certain security best practices fall on your shoulders as an user of these services. This guide assists you in strengthening the security of your cloud environment by leveraging features available in our Console.

Within this guide, you'll find concrete recommendations for:

- Securing access to the Cloud Temple Console;
- Managing and controlling access permissions effectively;
- Safeguarding resources deployed through our cloud services.

## Accessing the Console

Access to the Console serves as the primary entry point into your Cloud Temple's suite of cloud services. Therefore, securing it effectively is crucial.

### Restricting Console Access by IP Filtering

Access to the cloud management console is restricted to pre-authorized IP addresses. This limitation ensures that access is granted only to users from specified IP ranges, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

You can configure these IP filtering restrictions within your organization's settings. For detailed instructions on configuring IP filtering, refer to [Managing Access and Authentication | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/quickstart#access-and-authentication-management).

To optimize the effectiveness of this mechanism, ensure:

- **Limiting the number of authorized IPs** to only what is necessary;
- Avoiding overly broad or generic ranges;
- Adding only IPs from controlled environments (e.g., your company's internal network exit IP);
- Prohibiting or limiting individual IP addresses (e.g., a home public IP of your IT staff) as much as possible;
- Prohibiting or limiting IPs from third parties (e.g., service provider);
- Keeping this list updated in case of changes to your network infrastructure.

For remote access (telecommuting, third-party services), prioritize accessing via your company's network through a VPN rather than relying on individual address IP authorization. This reduces the exposed surface of the Console and centralizes access management within your organization.

### Utilize Identity Federation

Identity federation enables integration of the Cloud Temple Console with your identity provider (IdP), activating Single Sign-On (SSO). This approach centralizes authentication and offers several benefits:

- **Unified account management**: Creation, modification, and deletion via your directory;
- **Reduced attack surface**: Local accounts become unnecessary or limited;
- **Enhanced traceability**: Access is logged by your IdP;
- **Strengthened integration**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), alerting, contextual security policies…;
- **Easier compliance**: Alignment with internal security practices.

For these reasons, **identity federation is recommended**, especially for large-scale environments or those with high security requirements.

Follow our step-by-step guides to integrate your identity provider:

- [Configuring Identity Federation with Azure AD | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_aad)
- [Configuring Identity Federation with ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) significantly enhances the security of accessing the Cloud Temple Console. It adds an extra layer of authentication by requesting a temporary code generated by a dedicated application, in addition to your password. This measure substantially reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even in case of credential theft.

For locally managed accounts through the Console (without federation), MFA is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

**For federated accounts, it is highly recommended to enforce MFA on the identity provider's side**, especially for administrators with access to the Console.

- [Tutorial: Federated Identity with Microsoft Intune | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_intune)
- [Tutorial: Federated Identity with Azure AD | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_azuread)

### Accessing the Console from Secure Equipment

The location and environment from which you access the Console play a crucial role in securing service administration in the cloud. If you're operating within an environment with high security requirements, consider applying the following recommendations:

- For internal administration by your own teams, implement [Security Recommendations for IT System Administration | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/recommandations-relatives-ladministration-securisee-des-si) entirely or partially;
- In cases of third-party administration, evaluate the feasibility of engaging a [Secure Administration and Maintenance Provider (PAMS) | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/prestataires-dadministration-et-de-maintenance-securisees-pams), depending on the sensitivity of the hosted resources and your legal and regulatory context.

### Sensitize Administrators to Phishing Risks

Access to the Console Cloud Temple requires heightened vigilance, especially against attempts to steal credentials or MFA codes via phishing. It's crucial that authorized users are regularly educated on these risks: systematic URL verification, caution with unexpected messages, and immediate reporting of any suspicious activity.

To mitigate these risks, we recommend never accessing the Console through an email link but always manually entering the usual URL instead.

These practices fall under your responsibility as a client and are vital for thwarting phishing attacks. Should you have doubts, Cloud Temple support is readily available.

## Managing Cloud Services

Your cloud resources are managed from the console. This chapter provides essential recommendations for controlling the operation of cloud services.

### Identify Tenant Owners

The tenant owner holds all permissions related to the activated products and receives official notifications. It's crucial to ensure that your tenant owners are the appropriate contacts within your organization.

For secure and efficient management:

- **Designate a responsible owner**, ideally someone directly involved in managing the environment.
- **Verify the email address** of contact for the owner to ensure it’s valid and regularly checked.
- **Maintain direct oversight**, by adding an organization member as a tenant owner, even if you delegate cloud service management, to monitor critical notifications and decisions.
- **Limit the number of owners** to 3 to minimize exposure and simplify auditing of key actions.

For more information on managing tenant owners, refer to the [Tenant Owner Management Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/concepts#owner-management-on-a-tenant).

### Managing Permissions on Your Cloud Services

The Cloud Temple Console offers granular access management by assigning each user one or more permission levels, which precisely define the authorized actions. Refer to the permissions documentation ([Permissions available for your organization's users | Cloud Temple console](../../console/iam/concepts#available-permissions-for-users-in-your-organization)) for a detailed understanding of different permissions and appropriate attribution.

For efficient and secure permission management, we recommend adhering to these best practices:

- **Apply the principle of least privilege:** Grant users only the permissions necessary for their roles. This minimizes risks by limiting access to unnecessary functionalities.
- **Restrict sensitive permissions:** Assign sensitive permissions only to users responsible for those functions. Sensitive permissions typically involve access management (console_public_access_write, *_console_access, object - storage_write), permission management (iam_write, iam_offline_access), and backup management (backup_iaas_opensource_write, backup_iaas_spp_write).
- **Prioritize read-only access:** When in doubt, provide read-only access (\*\_read) to minimize risks while still allowing access to necessary information.
- **Conduct regular permission reviews:** Regularly review user permissions to remove outdated ones. Exporting permissions in CSV format simplifies this management process.

Masterful permission attribution reduces the risk of errors or malicious actions, enhancing your security posture.

### Regularly Update Hypervisors

Cloud Temple regularly provides updates for hypervisors to ensure the application of security patches. However, the responsibility of updating your hypervisors lies with you, as we do not have visibility into your business constraints.

Therefore, we recommend:

- **Regularly checking the Console** for new builds available for your hypervisors;  
- **Deploying regular updates** across all your hypervisors, especially those addressing security vulnerabilities;
- Regularly deploying updated vmtools on your virtual machines.

A Security Alerts page is available to inform you of known vulnerabilities and associated recommendations: [Security Alerts | Cloud Temple](https://docs.cloud-temple.com/console/security/security_alarms).

### Tracking Cloud Service Activity

To ensure effective monitoring of your cloud environment and swift response to anomalies, it's crucial to establish a proactive alerting strategy. We recommend:

- **Monitoring service availability** via the [Status Page | Cloud Temple](https://status.cloud-temple.com/), so you're notified of incidents or major outages;
- **Enabling thematic notifications** relevant to your usage from the Console, for real-time alerts on critical matters (see [Subscribe to Thematic Notifications | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/concepts#subscribing-to-themed-notifications)).
- **Utilizing Cloud Activity Logs** to pinpoint sensitive or suspicious actions on your resources (refer to "Logging - Tracking Activities" in the [Cloud Temple Getting Started Guide](https://docs.cloud-temple.com/iaas_vmware/quickstart#logging-tracking-activities)). The collection and analysis of activity logs can be automated using Console APIs, enabling integration with your monitoring or incident detection tools.

## Securing Hosted Resources

In a cloud computing model, securing the hosted resources falls on the user's responsibility. Cloud Temple offers a secure infrastructure, but it is your duty to safeguard your operating systems, data, and configurations.

Below are essential best practices for enhancing VM security: configuring backup policies, encrypting critical resources, and hardening operating systems. These measures help mitigate compromise risks, ensure data integrity, and guarantee business continuity in case of an incident.

### Configure Backup Management

To ensure the security and resilience of your data, it's crucial to properly define and apply your backup policies. Assigning a backup policy to each virtual machine before it starts is mandatory. The documentation for setting up backups can be found in the "Backup" section of the [Cloud Temple Quickstart Guide | Documentation](../../iaas_vmware/quickstart).

Here are the recommendations for managing backup policies of your Cloud Temple resources:

- **Define your backup policies:** Request from support the creation of backup policies tailored to your organization's security needs.  
- **Avoid suspended policies:** Ensure no virtual machine is associated with a suspended backup policy to prevent compromising data security.
- **Perform restore tests:** Regularly test restoring your backups to verify the effectiveness of your recovery procedures.

### Encrypting Sensitive VMs

In addition to encrypting data at the disk level, native for all cloud resources, **VM encryption can be enabled to safeguard your most sensitive resources**. For more details, refer to [Encrypting a VMware Machine | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../iaas_vmware/tutorials/vm_encryption).

Here are some best practices when using VM encryption:

- Enable encryption on sensitive VMs: Apply it either during the creation of the machine or as part of planned updates; the process requires temporarily stopping the VM.
- Verify encryption status: Confirm from the console that the VM displays the "encrypted" status correctly.
- Backup before encryption: Ensure the VM is properly backed up prior to any modifications.

### Limit Exposure of Your Resources

To minimize the attack surface of your virtual machines, it is strongly recommended to restrict exposed resources to only what is absolutely necessary. Specifically, ensure that your resource configurations prevent the public exposure of administration interfaces and consoles for deployed systems and applications.

If you are utilizing Cloud Temple Object Storage services, it is also advised not to configure your buckets with public access unless it's strictly required (refer to [Limiting Access to Your S3 Buckets | Cloud Temple Documentation](https://cloud-temple.com/storage/oss/quickstart?#access-policy-management)).

### Hardening Virtual Machines (IaaS Services)

Hosting a virtual machine on a secure cloud does not inherently ensure the security of the operating system, services, or applications it runs. Hardening virtual machines, whether self-managed or sourced from a catalog, falls under your responsibility.

We recommend you **apply basic security measures**:

- Keep systems updated with security patches;
- Limit exposed services;
- Disable unnecessary components;  
- Restrict access rights to the minimum necessary;
- Enable access logging;
- Configure regular backups.

To guide you through these actions, refer to:

- Security hardening guides provided by software vendors you use;
- [Essential Guides and Cybersecurity Best Practices | ANSSI (FR)](https://cyber.gouv.fr/guides-essentiels-et-bonnes-pratiques-de-cybersecurite-par-ou-commencer);
- [CIS Benchmarks® Security Guides | CIS (EN)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

These practices form the first line of defense for securing your systems in the cloud.

### Hardening Container (Securing Services PaaS)

To enhance the security of your containers within the OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), we recommend implementing the following measures for container hardening:

- **Image Sources**: Ensure all images come from trusted sources, such as internal registries or the Red Hat Container Catalog, and avoid using unverified community images available on public Docker Hub.
- **Privilege Restriction**: Utilize OpenShift's security features, including *Security Context Constraints (SCC)*, to limit container permissions strictly to what is necessary.
- **Custom SCC Configuration**: Create tailored SCCs for each application or group of applications. This includes restricting allowed system calls via *seccomp profiles*, with specific configurations like the prohibition of *ptrace* or *mount* to minimize risks of container escape.
- **Workload Isolation**: Leverage *Namespaces* and *Network Policies* to isolate workloads and limit unnecessary interactions between containers.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Activate logging via OpenShift's Operator for OpenShift Logging to capture events related to containers and hosted systems, facilitating better detection and analysis of suspicious activities.
