## Recommendations for the Secure Use of Cloud Temple Services

Cloud Temple services provide you with a highly secure cloud infrastructure by design. However, certain security best practices are your responsibility as a user of these services. This guide helps you strengthen the security of your cloud environment by leveraging the features offered in the Console.

You will find concrete recommendations for:

- Protecting access to the Cloud Console;
- Managing access and permissions in a controlled manner;
- Securing resources deployed through our cloud services.

## Console Access

Access to the Console is the gateway to all your Cloud Temple services. It is therefore essential to protect it effectively.

### Restrict Console Access by IP Filtering

Access to the cloud management console is limited to previously authorized IP addresses. This restriction allows access only to users from specified IP ranges, thus minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

You can configure these IP restrictions in your organization's settings. To learn how to configure IP filtering, see [Access Management and Authentication | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/quickstart?_highlight=*facteur#gestion-des-acc%C3%A8s-et-authentification).

To maximize the effectiveness of this mechanism, be sure to:

- **Limit the number of authorized IP addresses** to what is strictly necessary;
- Avoid overly broad or generic ranges;
- Add **only IPs from controlled environments** (e.g., your company network's outgoing IP);
- Prohibit, or limit as much as possible, individual IP addresses (e.g., home IP address of your IT staff);
- Prohibit, or limit, third-party IP addresses (e.g., service provider);
- Keep this list up to date when your network infrastructure evolves.

For remote access (teleworking, service providers, etc.), prefer routing through your company network via VPN rather than directly authorizing individual IP addresses. This reduces the Console's exposure surface and centralizes access management within your organization.

### Use Identity Federation

Identity federation allows you to integrate the Cloud Temple Console with your identity provider (IdP), enabling SSO. This approach centralizes authentication and offers several benefits:

- Unified account management: creation, modification, and deletion via your directory;
- Reduced attack surface: local accounts become unnecessary or limited;
- Increased traceability: accesses are logged by your IdP;
- Enhanced integration: MFA, alerting, contextual security policies, etc.;
- Facilitated compliance: consistency with your internal practices.

For these reasons, **identity federation is recommended**, particularly for environments with large staff or high security requirements.

Follow our step-by-step guides to integrate your identity provider:
- [Configure Federation with Azure AD | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_aad)
- [Configure Federation with ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly strengthens security access to the Cloud Temple Console. It adds an authentication step by requesting a temporary code generated by a dedicated application, in addition to the password. This measure greatly limits the risk of unauthorized access, even if credentials are stolen.

For accounts managed locally by the Console (without federation), MFA is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

**For federated accounts, it is strongly recommended to require MFA on the identity provider side**, especially for administrators with access to the Console.

- [Tutorial: Identity Federation with Microsoft ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Access the Console from Secure Equipment

The workstation and environment from which you access the Console are important for securing the administration of your cloud services. If you operate in an environment with high security requirements, you can apply the following recommendations:

- For administration by your own teams, apply all or part of the [Recommendations for Secure IS Administration | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/recommandations-relatives-ladministration-securisee-des-si);
- In case of administration by a third party, consider using a [Secure Administration and Maintenance Provider (PAMS) | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/prestataires-dadministration-et-de-maintenance-securisees-pams), depending on the sensitivity of the hosted resources and your legal and regulatory context.

### Raise Administrator Awareness of Phishing Risk

Access to the Cloud Temple Console requires heightened vigilance, particularly against phishing attempts aimed at stealing credentials or MFA codes. It is crucial that authorized users are regularly made aware of these risks: systematic verification of the URL, caution with unexpected messages, and immediate reporting of any suspicious activity.

To limit these risks, we recommend never accessing the Console via a link received by email, but always by manually entering the usual URL.

These best practices are your responsibility as a customer and are essential to prevent phishing attacks. If in doubt, Cloud Temple support remains at your disposal.

## Cloud Service Management

Your Cloud resources are managed from the Console. This chapter presents essential recommendations for controlling the operation of cloud services.

### Identify Tenant Owners

The tenant owner has all permissions related to activated products and receives official notifications. It is crucial to ensure that your tenant's owners are the appropriate contacts within your organization.

For secure and efficient management:

- **Identify a responsible owner**, preferably someone directly involved in managing the environment.
- **Verify the owner's email address** to ensure it is valid and regularly checked.
- **Ensure direct control** by adding an owner who is a member of your organization, even if you outsource the management of your cloud service, in order to supervise notifications and important decisions.
- **Limit the number of owners** to 3 to reduce the exposure surface and facilitate auditing of critical actions.

To learn more about tenant owner management, see the [Tenant Owner Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#gestion-des-propri%C3%A9taires-sur-un-tenant).

### Manage Permissions on Your Cloud Services

The Cloud Temple Console allows granular access management by assigning each user one or more permission levels, which precisely determine authorized actions. Consult the permissions documentation ([Permissions Available for Users in Your Organization | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#permissions-disponibles-pour-les-utilisateurs-de-votre-organisation)) to understand in detail the different permissions and assign them appropriately.

For effective and secure permission management, we recommend following these best practices:

- **Apply the principle of least privilege:** grant users only the permissions necessary for their missions. This reduces risks by limiting access to unnecessary functionalities.
- **Limit sensitive permissions:** Assign sensitive permissions only to users responsible for these functions. Sensitive permissions include access management (console\_public\_access\_write, \*\_console\_access, object - storage\_write), permission management (iam\_write, iam\_offline\_access), and backup management (backup\_iaas\_opensource\_write, backup\_iaas\_spp\_write).**
- **Prefer read-only access:** When in doubt, give read-only access (\*\_read) to minimize risks while allowing access to necessary information.
- **Conduct regular rights reviews:** Regularly check user permissions to remove obsolete ones. Exporting permissions to CSV format facilitates this management.**

Controlled permission assignment limits the risk of error or malicious action, while strengthening your security posture.

### Regularly Update Hypervisors

Cloud Temple regularly provides builds for hypervisors to ensure security patches are applied. However, updating hypervisors remains your responsibility, as we have no visibility into your business constraints.

Therefore, we recommend that you:

- Regularly check in the Console for the availability of new builds for your hypervisors;
- **Regularly deploy new builds on all your hypervisors**, especially if they fix security vulnerabilities;
- Regularly deploy new versions of vmtools on your virtual machines.

A security information page available in the Console helps identify known vulnerabilities and associated recommendations (builds to deploy, etc.).

### Monitor Activity on Cloud Services

To ensure effective monitoring of your cloud environment and react quickly in case of anomaly, it is essential to implement an active monitoring strategy. We particularly recommend:

- **Monitor service availability** via the [Status page | Cloud Temple](https://status.cloud-temple.com/), to be alerted in case of incidents or global outages;
- **Enable relevant thematic notifications** for your usage from the Console, to receive important alerts in real time (see [Subscription to Thematic Notifications | Cloud Temple Documentation](../console/iam/concepts#abonnement-aux-notifications-th%C3%A9matiques));
- **Leverage Cloud activity logs** to identify sensitive or suspicious actions on your resources (see "Logging - Activity Tracking" section of the [Getting Started Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/quickstart)). The collection and analysis of activity logs can be automated via the Console APIs, to integrate events into your monitoring or incident detection tools.

## Securing Hosted Resources

In a Cloud model, the security of deployed resources is the user's responsibility. Cloud Temple provides a secure infrastructure, but it is up to you to protect your operating systems, data, and configurations.

Below are essential best practices to strengthen the security of your VMs: configuring backup policies, encrypting critical resources, and hardening operating systems. These measures help limit the risk of compromise, ensure data integrity, and ensure business continuity in case of incident.

### Configure Backups

To ensure the security and resilience of your data, it is essential to properly define and apply your backup policies. Assigning a backup policy to each virtual machine before it starts is mandatory. Documentation is available in the "Backup" section of the [Getting Started Guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/quickstart).

Here are the recommendations for managing backup policies for your Cloud Temple resources:

- **Define your backup policies:** Ask support to create backup policies adapted to your organization's security needs.
- **Avoid suspended policies:** Do not leave any VM associated with a suspended backup policy to avoid compromising data security.
- **Perform restoration tests:** Regularly test the restoration of your backups to verify the effectiveness of your restoration procedures.

### Encrypt Sensitive VMs

In addition to data encryption at the disk level, native for all cloud resources, **VM encryption can be activated to protect your most sensitive resources**. For this, see [Encrypt a VMware Virtual Machine | Cloud Temple Documentation](../iaas_vmware/tutorials/vm_encryption?_highlight=*chiff).

Here are some best practices when using VM encryption:

- Enable encryption on sensitive VMs: Apply it when creating the machine or during a planned update. The operation requires temporarily stopping the VM;
- Verify encryption status: Check from the console that the VM displays the "encrypted" status;
- Backup before encryption: Ensure the VM is properly backed up before any modification.

### Restrict Resource Exposure

To limit the attack surface of your virtual machines, it is strongly recommended to restrict exposed services to what is strictly necessary. In particular, make sure to configure your resources to **not publicly expose administration interfaces and consoles** of deployed systems and applications.

If you use Cloud Temple Object Storage services, it is also advised to **not configure your buckets for public access**, except in cases where it is strictly necessary (see [Limiting Access to Your S3 Buckets | Cloud Temple Documentation](../storage/oss/quickstart?_highlight=*bucket#limitations-des-acc%C3%A8s-%C3%A0-vos-bucket-s3)).

### Harden Virtual Machines (IaaS Services)

Hosting a virtual machine on a secure cloud does not, by itself, guarantee the security of the operating system, services, or applications it runs. Hardening VMs, whether deployed by you or from the catalog, is your responsibility.

We recommend **applying basic security measures**:

- Keep systems updated with security patches;
- Limit exposed services;
- Disable unnecessary components;
- Restrict access rights to what is strictly necessary;
- Enable access logging;
- Configure regular backups.

To guide you in these actions, rely on:

- Hardening guides from the software vendors you use;
- [Essential Guides and Cybersecurity Best Practices | ANSSI (FR)](https://cyber.gouv.fr/guides-essentiels-et-bonnes-pratiques-de-cybersecurite-par-ou-commencer);
- [CIS Benchmarks® Security Guides | CIS (EN)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

These best practices constitute the first line of defense to secure your systems in the cloud.

### Harden Containers (PaaS Services)

To ensure the security of your containers within the OpenShift PaaS service, we recommend implementing the following measures to strengthen their hardening:

- **Image sources**: Ensure all images come from trusted sources, such as internal registries or the Red Hat Container Catalog, and avoid using unverified community images, like those available on the public Docker Hub.
- **Privilege restriction**: Limit container privileges by using OpenShift features, particularly Security Context Constraints (SCC), to restrict permissions to what is strictly necessary.
- **SCC configuration**: Create custom SCCs for each application or group of applications. This includes restricting authorized system calls (e.g., via seccomp profiles), with specific configurations such as prohibiting ptrace or mount to reduce the risk of container escapes.
- **Workload isolation**: Use Namespaces and Network Policies to isolate applications and limit unnecessary interactions between containers.
- **Complete logging**: Enable logging via the OpenShift Logging operator to capture events associated with containers and hosted systems, to better detect and analyze any suspicious activity.
