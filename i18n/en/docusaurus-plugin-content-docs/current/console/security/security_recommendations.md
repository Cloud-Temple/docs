## Recommendations for the secure use of Cloud Temple services

Cloud Temple services provide you with a cloud infrastructure that is highly secure by design. However, certain security best practices remain your responsibility as a user of these services. This guide helps you strengthen the security of your cloud environment by leveraging the features available in the Console.

It provides concrete recommendations to:

- Protect access to the Cloud Console;
- Manage access and permissions in a controlled manner;
- Secure resources deployed via our cloud services.

## Console Access

Access to the Console is the entry point to all your Cloud Temple services. It is therefore essential to secure it effectively.

### Restrict access to the Console through IP filtering

Access to the cloud management console is limited to pre-authorized IP addresses. This restriction ensures that only users from specified IP ranges can access it, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

You can configure these IP restrictions in your organization settings. To learn how to configure IP filtering, refer to [Identity and access management | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/quickstart?_highlight=*facteur#gestion-des-acc%C3%A8s-et-authentification).

To maximize the effectiveness of this mechanism, make sure to:

- **Limit the number of authorized IP addresses** to the strict minimum;
- Avoid overly broad or generic IP ranges;
- Add **only IPs from controlled environments** (e.g., your corporate network’s outbound IP);
- Avoid or minimize the use of individual IP addresses (e.g., an IT staff member's home public IP);
- Avoid or limit the use of third-party IP addresses (e.g., service providers);
- Keep this list up to date in case of changes to your network infrastructure.

For remote access (telework, contractors...) prefer routing through your corporate network using VPN rather than directly authorizing individual IP addresses. This reduces the Console’s exposure surface and centralizes access management within your organization.

### Use identity federation

Identity federation allows you to integrate the Cloud Temple Console with your Identity Provider (IdP) by enabling SSO. This approach centralizes authentication and provides several benefits:

- Unified account management: create, modify, and delete accounts via your directory;
- Reduced attack surface: local accounts become unnecessary or limited;
- Improved traceability: accesses are logged by your IdP;
- Enhanced integration: MFA, alerting, contextual security policies…;
- Easier compliance: consistent with your internal practices.

For these reasons, **identity federation is recommended**, especially in environments with large teams or high security requirements.

Follow our step-by-step guides to integrate your identity provider:

- [Configure federation with Azure AD | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_aad)
- [Configure federation with ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly strengthens access security to the Cloud Temple Console. It adds an additional authentication step by requiring a temporary code generated by a dedicated application, in addition to a password. This greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if credentials are stolen.

For accounts managed locally by the Console (without federation), MFA is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

**For federated accounts, it is strongly recommended to enforce MFA on the identity provider side**, especially for administrators with access to the Console.

- [Tutorial: Identity federation with Microsoft ADFS | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/tutorials/sso_adfs)

### Accessing the Console from secure devices

The workstation and environment from which you access the Console are important for securing the administration of your cloud services. If you operate in a high-security environment, consider applying the following recommendations:

- For administration by your own teams, apply all or part of the [Recommendations on secure administration of information systems | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/recommandations-relatives-ladministration-securisee-des-si);
- If administration is handled by a third party, consider involving an [Accredited secure administration and maintenance provider (PAMS) | ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/prestataires-dadministration-et-de-maintenance-securisees-pams), depending on the sensitivity of hosted resources and your legal and regulatory context.

### Raise administrator awareness of phishing risks

Access to the Cloud Temple Console requires heightened vigilance, especially against phishing attempts aimed at stealing credentials or MFA codes. It is essential that authorized users are regularly educated about these risks: always verifying the URL, exercising caution with unexpected messages, and immediately reporting any suspicious activity.

To mitigate these risks, we recommend never accessing the Console via a link received by email, but always manually entering the regular URL.

These best practices are your responsibility as a client, and are crucial for preventing phishing attacks. If in doubt, Cloud Temple support remains at your disposal.

## Cloud Services Management

Your Cloud resources are managed through the Console. This chapter outlines key recommendations for controlling the use of cloud services.

### Identify tenant owners

The tenant owner holds all permissions related to activated products and receives official notifications. It is crucial to ensure the owners of your tenant are the appropriate stakeholders within your organization.

For secure and efficient management:

- **Identify a responsible owner**, preferably someone directly involved in managing the environment.
- **Verify the owner's contact email address** to ensure it is valid and regularly monitored.
- **Ensure direct control**, by adding an owner who is a member of your organization, even if you outsource management of your cloud service, to maintain oversight of notifications and key decisions.
- **Limit the number of owners** to 3 to reduce the exposure surface and simplify the audit of critical actions.

To learn more about managing tenant owners, see the [Tenant ownership guide | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#gestion-des-propri%C3%A9taires-sur-un-tenant).

### Manage permissions on your cloud services

The Cloud Temple Console allows fine-grained access management by assigning one or more permission levels to each user, precisely determining the actions they can perform. See the permissions documentation ([Available permissions for users in your organization | Cloud Temple Documentation](../../console/iam/concepts?_highlight=*propri%C3%A9taire#permissions-disponibles-pour-les-utilisateurs-de-votre-organisation)) to understand the different permissions in detail and assign them appropriately.

For effective and secure permission management, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Apply the principle of least privilege:** grant users only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This limits risks by restricting access to non-essential features.
- **Limit sensitive permissions:** Assign sensitive permissions only to users responsible for these functions. Sensitive permissions include access management (console_public_access_write, *_console_access, object - storage_write), permission management (iam_write, iam_offline_access), and backup management (backup_iaas_opensource_write, backup_iaas_spp_write).
- **Favor read-only access:** In case of doubt, grant read-only access (*_read) to minimize risks while still allowing access to necessary information.
- **Conduct regular rights reviews:** Regularly review user permissions to remove obsolete ones. Exporting permissions in CSV format facilitates this management.

A controlled assignment of permissions limits the risk of error or malicious action while strengthening your security posture.

### Regularly update hypervisors

Cloud Temple regularly provides builds for hypervisors to ensure security patches are applied. However, updating hypervisors remains your responsibility, as we have no visibility into your business constraints.
Therefore, we recommend that you:

- Regularly check the Console for the availability of new builds for your hypervisors;  
- **Regularly deploy new builds across all your hypervisors**, especially when they fix security vulnerabilities;
- Regularly deploy the latest versions of vmtools to your virtual machines.

**A security alerts page is available** to inform you of known vulnerabilities and associated recommendations: [Alertes de sécurité | Cloud Temple](https://docs.cloud-temple.com/console/security/security_alarms).  

### Monitor activity on cloud services

To effectively monitor your cloud environment and respond quickly to anomalies, it is essential to implement an active monitoring strategy. Specifically, we recommend that you:

- **Monitor service availability** via the [Status page | Cloud Temple](https://status.cloud-temple.com/), in order to be alerted in the event of global incidents or outages;
- **Enable relevant topic-based notifications** for your use case from the Console, to receive important alerts in real time (see [Abonnement aux notifications thématiques | Documentation Cloud Temple](../../console/iam/concepts#abonnement-aux-notifications-th%C3%A9matiques));
- **Leverage Cloud activity logs** to identify sensitive or suspicious actions on your resources (see the “Logging - Activity Monitoring” section in the [Quick Start Guide | Documentation Cloud Temple](../../iaas_vmware/quickstart)). The collection and analysis of activity logs can be automated through the Console API, allowing events to be integrated into your supervision or incident detection tools.

## Secure hosted resources

In a Cloud model, the security of deployed resources is the user's responsibility. Cloud Temple provides a secure infrastructure, but it is up to you to protect your operating systems, data, and configurations.

Below are essential best practices to strengthen the security of your VMs: configuring backup policies, encrypting critical resources, and hardening operating systems. These measures help mitigate the risk of compromise, ensure data integrity, and maintain business continuity in the event of an incident.

### Configure backups

To ensure the security and resilience of your data, it is essential to properly define and apply your backup policies. Assigning a backup policy to each virtual machine before it is started is mandatory. Documentation is available in the "Backup" section of the [Quick Start Guide | Documentation Cloud Temple](../../iaas_vmware/quickstart).

Here are the recommendations for managing backup policies for your Cloud Temple resources:

- **Define your backup policies:** Request support to create backup policies tailored to your organization's security needs.  
- **Avoid suspended policies:** Do not leave any VM associated with a suspended backup policy to avoid compromising data security.
- **Perform restore tests:** Regularly test the restoration of your backups to verify the effectiveness of your restore procedures.

### Encrypt sensitive VMs

In addition to disk-level data encryption, which is native for all cloud resources, **VM encryption can be enabled to protect your most sensitive resources**. To do so, refer to [Encrypt a VMware virtual machine | Documentation Cloud Temple](../../iaas_vmware/tutorials/vm_encryption?_highlight=*chiff).

Here are some best practices when using VM encryption:

- Enable encryption on sensitive VMs: Apply it at the time of VM creation or during a planned update. The operation requires a temporary shutdown of the VM;
- Check encryption status: Verify from the console that the VM shows the status "encrypted";
- Backup before encrypting: Ensure the VM is properly backed up before making any changes.

### Limit the exposure of your resources

To reduce the attack surface of your virtual machines, it is strongly recommended to limit exposed services to only what is strictly necessary. In particular, ensure that your resources are configured to **not publicly expose administration interfaces and consoles** of deployed systems and applications.

If you use Cloud Temple's Object Storage services, it is also advised to **not configure your buckets for public access**, except in cases where it is strictly necessary (see [Limit access to your S3 buckets | Documentation Cloud Temple](../../storage/oss/quickstart?_highlight=*bucket#limitations-des-acc%C3%A8s-%C3%A0-vos-bucket-s3)).

### Harden virtual machines (IaaS services)

Hosting a virtual machine on a secure cloud does not, by itself, guarantee the security of the operating system, services, or applications it runs. Hardening VMs, whether self-deployed or from the catalog, is your responsibility.

We recommend that you **apply basic security measures**

- Keep systems up to date with security patches;
- Limit exposed services;
- Disable unused components;  
- Restrict access rights to the minimum necessary;
- Enable access logging;
- Configure regular backups.

To help guide these actions:

- Refer to the hardening guides from the software publishers you use;
- [Essential cybersecurity guides and best practices | ANSSI (FR)](https://cyber.gouv.fr/guides-essentiels-et-bonnes-pratiques-de-cybersecurite-par-ou-commencer);
- [CIS Benchmarks® Security Guides | CIS (EN)](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

These best practices form the first line of defense for securing your systems in the cloud.

### Harden containers (PaaS services)

To ensure the security of your containers within the OpenShift PaaS service, we recommend implementing the following measures to strengthen their hardening:

- **Image sourcing**: Ensure that all images come from trusted sources, such as internal registries or the Red Hat Container Catalog, and avoid using unverified community images such as those available on the public Docker Hub.
- **Privilege restriction**: Limit container privileges using OpenShift features, especially *Security Context Constraints* (SCC), to restrict permissions to only what is strictly necessary.
- **SCC configuration**: Create custom SCCs for each application or application group. This includes limiting allowed system calls (e.g., via *seccomp profiles*), with specific configurations such as disallowing *ptrace* or *mount* to reduce the risk of container escapes.
- **Workload isolation**: Use *Namespaces* and *Network Policies* to isolate applications and limit unnecessary interactions between containers.
- **Comprehensive logging**: Enable logging via the OpenShift Logging operator to capture events related to containers and hosted systems, for better detection and analysis of any suspicious activity.
