Then fill in the necessary connection information:

    - Protocol selection (SSH or RDP);
    - IP address of the host to manage;
    - Credentials;
    - Keyboard configuration.

Click "Connect" to open the Appliance. The console of the virtual machine to manage then opens.

## Prerequisites

1. Have subscribed to the Cloud Temple offer (Bastion Appliance subscription).
2. The equipment to manage must be accessible from the network where the Bastion Appliance is deployed.
3. Have the rights on the Bastion module.
4. In the case of an on-premise Appliance deployment, the corresponding flows must be opened.

## Connect to a device

Go to the "Devices" tab under the "Bastion" tab. Click on the action bar of the device you want to open, and click the "Open" button.

## Register a device

To access a device to manage regularly, it is more appropriate to create a device configuration, which will only require your username and password at each connection.

To do this, go to the "Devices" tab in the "Bastion" menu, then click the "New device" button.

<img src={creerSession} />

Then fill in the necessary information to create your device:

    - Device name;
    - Description;
    - Associated appliance;
    - Protocol type (SSH or RDP);
    - Host IP address;
    - Keyboard language.

<img src={creerSession2} />

A notification indicating the creation of your device configuration should appear in the top right corner of the page. The configuration is then added to your list of devices.

To create a new connection, you can also go through the "Appliances" tab by clicking the action bar of the appliance to which you want to associate a device configuration.

## Interface

Once connected to the Shiva web portal, go to the "Bastion" tab in the left menu.

The "Equipements" tab allows you to view your equipment list. An equipment corresponds to a connection configuration via a Bastion Appliance. For each equipment, its name, tags, description, associated Appliance, connection type (SSH or RDP), host IP, and keyboard configuration are indicated.

You can filter your equipment list according to the tags assigned to them, and a search engine allows you to look for a session by its name.

<img src={sessions2} />

The "Appliances" tab provides a list of your Bastion Appliances. For each Appliance, the Appliance's name and description are specified.

A search engine is available to help you search for an Appliance by its name.
