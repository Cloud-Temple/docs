The Provider ensures the provision of advanced fire detection and extinguishing services, designed to effectively identify and neutralize any fire outbreak within the facilities. These systems are essential to guarantee the safety of equipment and data. They include high-precision smoke detectors and extinguishing devices that can act quickly without damaging computer equipment. This service is crucial for preventing fire risks, minimizing potential damage, and ensuring operational continuity.

The CLIENT is informed that all security procedures and measures in place, including annual failover tests on generators, are essential to guarantee the continuity and integrity of the services provided. These practices are designed to minimize the risk of failure and ensure optimal responsiveness in case of an Incident. By accepting these conditions, the CLIENT acknowledges the importance of these measures and undertakes to cooperate fully to facilitate their implementation. The CLIENT is also encouraged to take note of the security recommendations provided and to integrate them into their own risk management strategy.

### 7.2.2. Service management software infrastructure

The Provider provides the CLIENT with the administration console and API necessary for using the Service. It also undertakes to maintain this administration console and API in optimal operational condition and to ensure their security continuously. This administration console and API are collectively referred to as the "CLIENT interface".

The Provider alerts the CLIENT to the fact that abnormal use of the CLIENT interface, particularly in the event of overloading its command APIs (hammering), may trigger automatic security measures resulting in the blocking of access to the command APIs or the Service. It should be emphasized that this situation does not constitute an unavailability of the Service but an action to protect the Service and the Provider's infrastructure; consequently, the CLIENT cannot consider it as an unavailability in their calculations.

In addition, the Provider specifies to the CLIENT that perfectly identical requests (duplicates) sent to its APIs are limited to one per second (Throttling). If the CLIENT submits identical requests at a higher frequency, their rejection cannot be interpreted as an unavailability of the Service.

### 7.2.3. Computing infrastructures

The Service includes the provision, in the availability zones subscribed to by the CLIENT, of the equipment necessary for the execution of workloads in the form of virtual machines.

This includes:

- The provision of technical chassis necessary for the proper functioning of the compute blades;
- The provision of compute blades in the quantities specified by the CLIENT and distributed according to the availability zones of their choice. It should be noted that these compute blades are exclusively dedicated to the CLIENT;
- The provision of a KVM-type console to manage the compute resource

The choice of the compute blade model, selected from the catalog proposed by the Provider, is the responsibility of the CLIENT.

### 7.2.4. Storage infrastructure

The service includes providing the CLIENT with a shared SAN (Storage Area Network) type storage infrastructure, offering various performance levels. This service encompasses:

- The implementation and maintenance of the dedicated SAN network in operational and security condition;
- The installation and management of storage arrays shared between clients, including their maintenance in operational and security condition, their supervision and their metrology;
- The implementation of automated systems for the allocation of LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers) dedicated to the CLIENT's use, in accordance with the volumes subscribed by the CLIENT.

### 7.2.5. Global network infrastructure

The Provider deploys, as part of the Service, a global network facilitating the accessibility of the CLIENT's hosted systems. This service includes:

- The provision, maintenance in operational and security condition of all fiber optic links interconnecting the different Availability Zones;

- The provision, maintenance in operational and security condition of the technical equipment necessary for the proper functioning of the network and the isolation of different clients.

The network interconnection of the CLIENT Tenant, to the Internet or to private networks, and the network equipment, operator links and other technical components implementing this interconnection, are not part of the scope of the Service. This network interconnection is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Contract.

### 7.2.6. Implementation of disaster recovery or business continuity solutions

The Provider provides the CLIENT with all the technical solutions necessary to guarantee an optimal distribution of their resources across various Availability Zones. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to effectively manage this resource distribution, for which they have the possibility to use the Provider's tools available for this purpose.

## 7.3. Service limitations in the qualified Bare Metal model

### 7.3.1. Managed services in RUN

It is important to note that the following are excluded from the Service:

- Hosting of physical components of the CLIENT;

- Network interconnection of the CLIENT Tenant, to the Internet or to private networks, including operator links;

- Any type of managed service, or TMA;

- Any assistance on installed operating systems and above in the responsibility stack, even if it is simple monitoring.

That being said, it is absolutely not excluded that the CLIENT may use such services from the Provider's MSP offering to intervene in managed services mode on their Tenants. These services will then not be governed by this Service Agreement and its bilateral commitments/clauses.

### 7.3.2. Backup configuration

By default, the Provider provides the setup of Bare Metal resources to the CLIENT by reserving resources and configuring deployments to use Availability Zones. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to choose the Availability Zones via the CLIENT interface.

## 7.4. Service implementation

### 7.4.1. Technical prerequisites

For the implementation of the Service, the CLIENT acknowledges that they will need to:

- Declare fixed IPs from which the Provider will authorize them to access the CLIENT interface (Filtering by whitelist). Modifications to this IP list must be made via the menu provided for this purpose in the console or via Service Requests for subsequent modifications. At the initialization of the service, the Provider will have been informed of at least 1 IP address as described.

## 7.5. Service location in France

It is specified that none of the operations and none of the physical components involved in the provision of the Service, which is the subject of this Service Agreement, is located outside the European Union.

This includes, in particular, support, operational supervision and security supervision (SOC) of the technical infrastructure delivering the Service. In fact, all storage, all administration tasks, supervision and all processing are carried out in France.

Cloud Temple employees working on the Service perimeter operate from Cloud Temple agencies all located exclusively in France. These agencies are located in France, in Tours, Lyon, Caen and Paris La Défense.

The CLIENT is informed of the possibility of Cloud Temple employees working remotely. However, the Provider guarantees the same level of security regarding remote access, particularly concerning VPN access. These remote accesses are implemented in accordance with the requirements of the SecNumCloud reference framework.

## 7.6. Support

### 7.6.1. Nature of support accompanying the service

The Provider provides a technical support service aimed at assisting the CLIENT in the management, troubleshooting and optimization of their deployed resources. This service covers a wide range of activities, from assistance with the initial configuration of services to advanced technical support to resolve specific problems.

Here is a description of the characteristics and functionalities of the support service:

- Assistance with the initial implementation of the Service use;
- Assistance with incident resolution;
- Assistance with problem resolution;
- Monitoring and advice on technical infrastructure optimization.

As part of the support service, the Provider does not substitute for the CLIENT in the use of the Service. The CLIENT remains entirely responsible for the configuration, operation of their VMs and their Tenants, and the management of all elements (including data and applications) that they have stored or installed on the Provider's infrastructures. The technical support service is provided in accordance with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use, with the Provider being bound by an obligation of means.

The CLIENT undertakes to use the technical support service in a reasonable manner, refraining in particular from requesting services not subscribed to from the Provider and from having the Provider's teams intervene with their own clients or third parties not included in the Contract. The Provider reserves the right to reject any service request that does not comply with these criteria.

The level of support commitment is conditional on the subscription of the associated support work units.

### 7.6.2. Requesting technical support service

Technical support is accessible through a ticket system via the CLIENT console and is available during normal office hours, excluding public holidays (8am - 6pm; Monday -- Friday; French calendar and hours). For emergencies occurring outside business hours, particularly incidents significantly affecting production, the on-call service can be reached via a number communicated to the CLIENT at the initialization of the Service.

For each request or Incident, it is imperative to generate a ticket with the Provider's support. The initialization of this ticket, including all necessary information, is essential and marks the beginning of the evaluation of the Provider's commitments.

As soon as the Provider receives a request or an Incident notification, whether through the management console or following a telephone call, a ticket is automatically created. When declaring an Incident, it is essential that the CLIENT provides the provider with as much detail as possible about the problem encountered. This approach is crucial to allow an adequate assessment of the situation, its prioritization and an effective diagnosis.

The CLIENT then receives a confirmation by email, indicating the creation of the ticket and its unique number. The CLIENT can consult the status and history of their requests and Incident declarations directly from the management console.

### 7.6.3. Incident management process

When an Incident is declared, the Provider's technical support team initiates an investigation to identify the cause of the problem and establish a diagnosis. The CLIENT must actively collaborate with the Provider by providing all necessary information and performing the required tests. The Provider may access the CLIENT's Service to diagnose the Incident.

If the Provider's Services are deemed functional and the Incident is not attributable to them, the CLIENT will be informed. At the CLIENT's request, the Provider may propose Professional Services to identify the origin of the problem, billable upon prior agreement in 30-minute increments.

In the event that the Incident is the responsibility of the Provider or one of its subcontractors, the latter completes the diagnosis and works on restoring the Service at no additional cost. The diagnosis is based on exchanges between the Parties and the Provider's data, these elements being considered as probative by agreement of the Parties.

### 7.6.4. Treatment prioritization process

The determination of the priority level of a case is based on a matrix analysis that evaluates the impact of the Incident and its degree of criticality:

- Impact levels are defined as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact level     Description
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact I1         The Provider's service(s) are interrupted

  Impact I2         The Provider's service(s) are degraded

Impact I3         The Provider's service(s) are currently stable, but show signs of potential long-term decline
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Criticality levels are defined as follows:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality level   Description
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality C1          The Provider's service(s) are degrading at a concerning rate

  Criticality C2          The Provider's service(s) deteriorate progressively over time

Criticality C3          The Provider's service(s) present one or more inconveniences without significant consequences
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Based on a thorough analysis of the situation, taking into account the elements determining the Impact and Criticality, a priority is assigned to the ticket in accordance with the decision matrix below:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact level  Criticality level   Impact I1         Impact I2         Impact I3
  -------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Criticality C1                           Priority **P1**   Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**

  Criticality C2                           Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**
