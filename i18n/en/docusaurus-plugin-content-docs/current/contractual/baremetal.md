  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(\*) Within the limits of the Service scope defined in the SLA and the Provider's responsibilities in this regard\_

### 7.2.1. Datacenter Infrastructures

The Service includes the provision, for each Availability Zone, of the qualifications currently being assessed as follows:

-   Datacenter site located in France for the FR Region, compliant with the latest technological standards, offering a resilience level equivalent to or higher than Tier 3 of the Uptime Institute;
-   Provision of technical rooms within dedicated datacenters to host the essential technical equipment for service production, including compute, storage, network, cabling, and other necessary components;
-   Secure electrical supply, ensured by two distinct electrical circuits, guaranteeing service continuity;
-   Provision of air conditioning services, adjusted to meet equipment manufacturers' standards and recommendations, to maintain an optimal environment for technical devices;
-   Continuous monitoring and detailed metrology, allowing precise monitoring and proactive management of the performance and security of the provided service.

The Provider ensures the provisioning of advanced fire detection and suppression services, designed to effectively identify and neutralize any fire outbreak within the facilities. These systems are essential to guarantee the safety of equipment and data. They include high-precision smoke detectors and suppression devices that can act quickly without damaging IT equipment. This service is crucial for preventing fire risks, minimizing potential damage, and ensuring the continuity of operations.

The SPONSOR is informed that all security procedures and measures in place, including annual switch-over tests on the generators, are crucial to ensure the continuity and integrity of the provided services. These practices are designed to minimize outage risks and ensure optimal responsiveness in case of an Incident. By accepting these conditions, the SPONSOR acknowledges the importance of these measures and commits to fully cooperate to facilitate their implementation. The SPONSOR is also encouraged to review the provided security recommendations and integrate them into their own risk management strategy.

### 7.2.2. Service Management Software Infrastructure

The Provider supplies the SPONSOR with the administration console and the necessary API to use the Service. The Provider also commits to maintain this administration console and API in optimal operational condition and ensure their continuous security. This administration console and API are collectively referred to as the “SPONSOR interface.”

The Provider alerts the SPONSOR that abnormal use of the SPONSOR interface, especially in the event of overloading its command APIs (hammering), can trigger automatic security measures resulting in the blocking of access to the command APIs or the Service. It should be emphasized that this situation does not constitute a Service unavailability but a protection action for the Service and the Provider's infrastructure; therefore, the SPONSOR cannot consider it as downtime in their calculations.

Additionally, the Provider specifies to the SPONSOR that perfectly identical requests (duplicates) sent to its APIs are limited to one per second (Throttling). If the SPONSOR submits identical requests at a higher frequency, their rejection cannot be interpreted as Service unavailability.

### 7.2.3. Compute Infrastructures

The Service includes the provision, in the Availability Zones subscribed by the SPONSOR, of the necessary equipment to execute workloads in the form of virtual machines.

This includes:

-   Provision of technical chassis necessary for the proper functioning of compute blades;
-   Provision of compute blades in quantities specified by the SPONSOR and distributed according to their chosen Availability Zones. It should be noted that these compute blades are exclusively dedicated to the SPONSOR;
-   Provision of a KVM-type console to manage the compute resource

The choice of the compute blade model, selected from the catalog offered by the Provider, is the SPONSOR's responsibility.

### 7.2.4. Storage Infrastructure

The service includes the provisioning for the SPONSOR of a shared storage infrastructure of the SAN (Storage Area Network) type, offering various levels of performance. This service encompasses:

-   Implementation and maintaining the operational and security conditions of the dedicated SAN network;
-   Installation and management of shared storage arrays between clients, including their maintenance in operational and security condition, monitoring, and metrology;
-   Implementation of automated systems for the allocation of storage-dedicated LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers) for the SPONSOR's use, according to the volumes subscribed by the SPONSOR.

### 7.2.5. Global Network Infrastructure

The Provider deploys, within the Service framework, a global network facilitating the SPONSOR's access to their hosted systems. This service includes:

-   Provision, maintenance of operational and security conditions of all optical fiber links interconnecting the various Availability Zones;

-   Provision, maintenance of operational and security conditions of the technical equipment necessary for the proper functioning of the network and the isolation of different clients.

The SPONSOR Tenant's network interconnection to the Internet or private networks, and the network equipment, operator links, and other technical components realizing this interconnection are not part of the Service scope. This network interconnection is implemented according to the provisions outlined in the Contract.

### 7.2.6. Implementation of Business Continuity or Disaster Recovery Solutions

The Provider supplies the SPONSOR with all the necessary technical solutions to ensure optimal distribution of their resources across various Availability Zones. It is the SPONSOR's responsibility to effectively manage this resource distribution, for which they can utilize the Provider's tools available for this purpose.

## 7.3 Service Limitations in the Qualified Bare Metal Model

### 7.3.1. Managed Services in RUN

It is important to note that the Service does not include:

-   Hosting of the SPONSOR's physical components;

-   Network interconnection of the SPONSOR Tenant, to the Internet or private networks, including operator links;

-   Any type of managed service, or TMA;

-   Any assistance on operating systems installed and above in the responsibility stack, even if it is just monitoring.

That said, it is absolutely not excluded that the SPONSOR may resort to such services through the Provider's MSP offering to operate in managed services mode on their Tenants. These services will not then be governed by this Service Agreement and its commitments/bipartite clauses.

### 7.3.2. Backup Configuration

By default, the Provider sets up the Bare Metal resources for the SPONSOR by reserving resources and configuring deployments to use the Availability Zones. It is the SPONSOR's responsibility to choose the Availability Zones via the SPONSOR interface.

## 7.4 Service Implementation

### 7.4.1. Technical Prerequisites

For the implementation of the Service, the SPONSOR recognizes that they will need to:

-   Declare fixed IPs from which the Provider will allow access to the SPONSOR interface (Whitelisting). Changes to this IP list must be made via the menu provided for this purpose in the console or via Service Requests for subsequent changes. At the service initialization, the Provider will have been informed of at least 1 IP address as described.

## 7.5 Service Location in France

It is specified that none of the operations and none of the physical components involved in providing the Service, which this Service Agreement covers, are located outside the European Union.
This includes, in particular, support, operational monitoring, and security monitoring (SOC) of the technical infrastructure delivering the Service. In fact, all storage, all administration tasks, supervision, and all processing are carried out in France.

### 7.5.1. Datacenter Locations Hosting the Service

Apart from the operations of the Provider's employees and agencies, all production operations (including data storage and processing) and technical components delivering the Service are located in datacenters based in France.

### 7.5.2. Cloud Temple Agency Locations Operating the Service

Cloud Temple employees working on the Service perimeter operate from Cloud Temple agencies all located exclusively in France. These agencies are located in France, in Tours, Lyon, Caen, and Paris La Défense.

The CLIENT is informed of the possibility for Cloud Temple employees to work remotely. However, the Provider guarantees the same level of security regarding remote access, particularly regarding VPN access. These remote accesses are implemented in accordance with the requirements of the SecNumCloud reference framework.

## 7.6. Support

### 7.6.1. Nature of Support Accompanying the Service

The Provider provides technical support services aimed at assisting the CLIENT in managing, troubleshooting, and optimizing their deployed resources. This service covers a wide range of activities, from initial service configuration assistance to advanced technical support for resolving specific issues.

Here is a description of the features and functionalities of the support service:

-   Assistance with the initial implementation of the Service;
-   Incident resolution assistance;
-   Problem resolution assistance;
-   Monitoring and advice on technical foundation optimization.

As part of the support service, the Provider does not replace the CLIENT in using the Service. The CLIENT remains entirely responsible for the configuration, operation of their VMs and Tenants, and the management of all elements (including data and applications) they have stored or installed on the Provider's infrastructure. The technical support service is provided in accordance with the General Terms of Sale and Use, with the Provider being committed to a best-effort obligation.

The CLIENT agrees to use the technical support service in a reasonable manner, refraining from requesting services not subscribed to from the Provider and involving the Provider's teams with their own clients or third parties not included in the Contract. The Provider reserves the right to reject any service request that does not meet these criteria.

The support engagement level is conditioned on the subscription of the associated support work units.

### 7.6.2. Technical Support Service Request

Technical support is accessible through a ticketing system via the CLIENT console and is available during regular office hours, excluding public holidays (8 AM - 6 PM; Monday — Friday; French calendar and hours). For emergencies occurring outside of business hours, particularly incidents significantly affecting production, the on-call service can be reached via a number provided to the CLIENT at the Service initialization.

For each request or Incident, it is essential to generate a ticket with the Provider's support. The initiation of this ticket, including all necessary information, is essential and marks the beginning of the Provider's commitment evaluation.

As soon as the Provider receives a request or Incident notification, either through the management console or following a phone call, a ticket is automatically created. When reporting an Incident, it is essential for the CLIENT to provide the Provider with as many details as possible about the encountered problem. This approach is crucial for allowing an adequate evaluation of the situation, its prioritization, and effective diagnosis.

The CLIENT then receives a confirmation email, indicating the ticket's creation and its unique number. The CLIENT can consult the status and history of their requests and Incident reports directly from the management console.

### 7.6.3. Incident Management Process

When reporting an Incident, the Provider's technical support team begins an investigation to identify the cause of the problem and establish a diagnosis. The CLIENT must actively collaborate with the Provider by providing all necessary information and performing the required tests. The Provider may access the CLIENT's Service to diagnose the Incident.

If the Provider's Services are deemed functional and the Incident is not attributable to the Provider, the CLIENT will be informed. At the CLIENT's request, the Provider may offer Professional Services to identify the problem's origin, billable in advance in 30-minute increments.

If the Incident is the responsibility of the Provider or one of its subcontractors, the Provider completes the diagnosis and works to restore the Service at no additional cost. The diagnosis relies on exchanges between the Parties and the Provider's data, these elements being considered as evidence by agreement of the Parties.

### 7.6.4. Incident Handling Prioritization Process

The determination of the priority level of a case is based on a matrix analysis evaluating the Incident's impact and its degree of criticality:

-   Impact levels are defined as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact Level       Description
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact I1         The Provider's services are interrupted

  Impact I2         The Provider's services are degraded

  Impact I3         The Provider's services are currently stable but show signs of potential long-term decline
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Criticality levels are defined as follows:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality Level   Description
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality C1      The Provider's services are deteriorating at a worrying rate

  Criticality C2      The Provider's services are gradually deteriorating over time

  Criticality C3      The Provider's services present one or more inconveniences without significant consequence
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Based on a thorough analysis of the situation, considering the elements determining the Impact and Criticality, a priority is assigned to the ticket according to the following decision matrix:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact Level      Criticality Level   Impact I1         Impact I2         Impact I3
  -------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Criticality C1                          Priority **P1**   Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**

  Criticality C2                          Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**   Priority **P4**

  Criticality C3                          Priority **P3**   Priority **P4**   Priority **P5**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The service level commitments corresponding to each priority level are detailed in the following chapter.

### 7.6.5. Language and Location of Support Service

Support is provided by the Provider to the CLIENT at a minimum in the French language. Support can also be provided in English.

The Provider's support service operations for the Bare Metal service offer being qualified for SecNumCloud are located in the European Union.

# 8. Service Commitments and Levels

The Provider is committed to ensuring continuous monitoring of the performance and security integrity of its technical infrastructure delivering the Service, ensuring their optimal functioning.

The unavailability of a service, subject to a performance indicator, is recognized as soon as it is identified by the Provider's monitoring system or following a notification from a CLIENT user. The start of unavailability is set at the earliest moment between these two events, to ensure an accurate and fair count of downtime.

The end of the unavailability is officially marked by the complete restoration of the service, confirmed either by the Provider's monitoring tools or by user feedback, ensuring an effective resumption of operations and an accurate measurement of the interruption duration.

## 8.1. Infrastructure Availability Commitments
The Service Provider commits to maintaining an availability and performance level in accordance with the standards defined for each specified period. The Service Level Agreements (SLAs) apply provided that the CLIENT deploys its systems across at least two of the Availability Zones present in the relevant Region.

In the absence of compliance with these conditions by the CLIENT, it will be unable to claim the application of the concerned SLAs, which are specifically identified by an asterisk (\*). Accessibility to the SLAs is made available via the CLIENT interface. The measurements are calculated monthly:

-   \*\*SLA 1 (\*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-01\*\* -- Compute availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
-   \*\*SLA 2 (\*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-02\*\* -- Storage availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
-   \*\*SLA 3 (\*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-03\*\* -- Network infrastructure availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
-   **SLA 4: IC-INFRA_SNC-04** -- Internet Access: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.

***Remarks***:

-   *In response to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, the Service Provider reserves the right to adjust its internet routing configuration to limit the impact of this attack and safeguard its infrastructure. Specifically, if an IP address belonging to the CLIENT is targeted, the Service Provider may use the blackholing technique via the BGP community to block all traffic to the targeted IP address upstream with its providers, in order to protect the CLIENT's resources as well as those of other CLIENTs and the Service Provider's infrastructure. The Service Provider strongly encourages the CLIENT to adopt similar measures, such as using commercially available web application firewall software, and to carefully configure its security groups via the command API.*

-   *The Service Provider emphasizes the need for the CLIENT to minimize the flow openings, notably avoiding opening administrative ports **SSH** (TCP port 22) and **RDP** (TCP port 3389) to the entire Internet (subnet 0.0.0.0/0), as well as internal protocols such as **SMB** (TCP/UDP port 445) or **NFS** (TCP/UDP port 2049).*

## 8.2. CLIENT interface availability commitment

-   SLA 5: IC-INFRA_SNC-05 -- Access to the Service administration console: a guaranteed availability of 97%, ensured continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
-   SLA 6: IC-INFRA_SNC-06 -- Access to the Service management APIs: an availability of 99.9%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.

## 8.3. Support availability commitment

-   **SLA 7: IC-INFRA_SNC-07** -- Here are the performance commitments of the Service Provider's technical support for incidents, excluding scheduled maintenance:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Priority          Intervention Time Guarantee (ITG)         Performance Objective
  ----------------- ---------------------------------------- ------------------------
  Priority **P1**   30min                                      95%

  Priority **P2**   2h                                         90%

  Priority **P3**   4h                                         90%

  Priority **P4**   24h                                        85%

  Priority **P5**   48h                                        85%
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **SLA 8: IC-INFRA_SNC-08** -- Here are the performance commitments of the Service Provider's technical support for service requests:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Intervention Time Guarantee (ITG)        Performance Objective
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------------------------
  Service request     4h                                         90%
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note*:

-   *The Intervention Time Guarantee (ITG) is calculated from the difference between the time the CLIENT opens the ticket and the first intervention by the Service Provider's support.*
-   *Incident investigation for CLIENTs will not include remote intervention on the CLIENT's hosted servers. This assistance will be limited to explaining available metrics related to the CLIENT's environment to facilitate understanding of incidents or performance issues encountered. Based on the results of this analysis, recommendations may be suggested.*

It is the SPONSOR's responsibility to provide the necessary access to the Service Provider's personnel, according to specific hosting needs and, if applicable, professional support services if this option has been chosen by the SPONSOR.

The SPONSOR acknowledges that these accesses are granted exclusively for service delivery purposes agreed upon, ensuring secure and compliant management according to the agreement terms.

Remote access by third parties involved in the Service Provider's service delivery is strictly prohibited. In the event a specific technical requirement necessitates such access, it can only be established after clearly notifying the SPONSOR, providing a detailed justification, and obtaining their written consent.

This measure guarantees the control and security of the SPONSOR's data, ensuring that any exception to the rule is duly authorized and documented.

## 9.4. Responsibilities of third parties participating in service delivery

The Service Provider oversees the list of third-party partners participating in the Service delivery. These third parties include publishers, service providers (of the Service Provider), and other suppliers involved in providing the Service. The Service Provider applies the following measures to these third parties:

-   The Service Provider requires third parties involved in service implementation to provide a security level at least equivalent to that maintained in its own security policy applicable to the service;

-   The Service Provider contracts with each third party involved in service implementation, including audit clauses allowing a qualification body to verify that these third parties comply with legal requirements and SNC requirements, enabling the Service Provider to meet its commitments in this Service Agreement.

-   The Service Provider implements a procedure to regularly monitor measures put in place by third parties involved in service implementation to comply with the requirements enabling the Service Provider to meet its commitments in this Service Agreement.

-   The Service Provider tracks changes made by third parties involved in service implementation that may affect the information system's security level of the service.

## 9.5. Responsibilities and obligations of the SPONSOR

The SPONSOR has the following obligations within the scope of the Service:

-   As a reminder, the Service Provider provides the SPONSOR with a computing platform (server without OS), whose configuration is the responsibility of the SPONSOR.

-   The SPONSOR authorizes ANSSI and the SNC qualification body to audit the Service and the technical infrastructure delivering the Service.

-   The SPONSOR is responsible for notifying the Service Provider of any specific sectoral requirements related to the types of information entrusted by the SPONSOR and needing consideration by the Service Provider.

-   The SPONSOR agrees not to request the Service Provider for requirements or actions that would make the Service Provider deviate from the requirements of the current version of the SecNumCloud reference framework or lower the security level established by meeting the requirements of this same reference framework.

## 9.6. Rights of the SPONSOR

At any time during the contractual relationship, the SPONSOR may file a complaint regarding the qualified service with ANSSI.

At any time, the SPONSOR may request the Service Provider to provide access to its internal regulations and code of ethics.

## 9.7. Data Deletion at the End of the Contract
