- Continuous monitoring and detailed metrology, enabling precise tracking and proactive management of service performance and security.

The Provider ensures the availability of advanced fire detection and suppression services, designed to identify and effectively neutralize any fire incidents within the facilities. These systems are essential to guarantee equipment and data security. They include high-precision smoke detectors and suppression devices that can act quickly without damaging computer equipment. This service is crucial for preventing fire risks, minimizing potential damage, and ensuring operational continuity.

The COMMANDITAIRE is informed that all implemented security procedures and measures, including annual backup generator tests, are essential to ensure service continuity and integrity. These practices are designed to minimize failure risks and ensure optimal responsiveness in case of an Incident. By accepting these conditions, the COMMANDITAIRE acknowledges the importance of these measures and commits to fully cooperating to facilitate their implementation. The COMMANDITAIRE is also encouraged to familiarize themselves with the provided security recommendations and integrate them into their own risk management strategy.

### 7.2.2. Service Management Software Infrastructure

The Provider provides the COMMANDITAIRE with the administration console and necessary API for using the Service. It also commits to maintaining this administration console and API in optimal operational condition and ensuring continuous security. This administration console and API are collectively referred to as the "COMMANDITAIRE interface."

The Provider alerts the COMMANDITAIRE that abnormal use of the COMMANDITAIRE interface, particularly API command overloads (hammering), may trigger automatic security measures resulting in blocking access to command APIs or the Service. It should be noted that this situation does not constitute Service unavailability but a protective action for the Service and Provider's infrastructure; therefore, the COMMANDITAIRE cannot consider it as unavailability in their calculations.

Additionally, the Provider informs the COMMANDITAIRE that identical requests (duplicates) sent to its APIs are limited to one per second (Throttling). If the COMMANDITAIRE submits identical requests at a higher frequency, their rejection cannot be interpreted as Service unavailability.

### 7.2.3. Computing Infrastructure

The Service includes the provision, in the Availability Zones subscribed by the COMMANDITAIRE, of the equipment necessary for executing workloads in the form of virtual machines.

This includes:

- Provision of technical chassis necessary for the proper operation of compute blades;
- Provision of compute blades in the quantities specified by the COMMANDITAIRE and distributed according to their chosen Availability Zones. It should be noted that these compute blades are exclusively dedicated to the COMMANDITAIRE;
- Provision of a standard KVM console for managing computing resources

The choice of compute blade model, selected from the catalog offered by the Provider, falls under the COMMANDITAIRE's responsibility.

### 7.2.4. Storage Infrastructure

The service includes the provision of a shared storage infrastructure of the SAN (Storage Area Network) type to the COMMANDITAIRE, offering various performance levels. This service encompasses:

- Implementation and maintenance of the dedicated SAN network in operational and security conditions;
- Installation and management of shared storage cabinets among customers, including their maintenance in operational and security conditions, monitoring, and metrology;
- Implementation of automated systems for allocating storage LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers) dedicated to the COMMANDITAIRE's use, according to the volumes subscribed by the COMMANDITAIRE.

### 7.2.5. Global Network Infrastructure

The Provider deploys within the Service a global network facilitating the COMMANDITAIRE's accessibility of its hosted systems. This service includes:

- Provision, maintenance in operational and security conditions of all fiber optic interconnection links between different Availability Zones;

- Provision, maintenance in operational and security conditions of the technical equipment necessary for network functionality and isolation of different customers.

The Tenant COMMANDITAIRE's network interconnection with the Internet or private networks, and the network equipment, operator links, and other technical components implementing this interconnection, are not part of the Service scope. This network interconnection is implemented in accordance with the provisions outlined in the Contract.

### 7.2.6. Implementation of Business Continuity or Disaster Recovery Solutions

The Provider provides the COMMANDITAIRE with all necessary technical solutions to ensure optimal resource distribution across various Availability Zones. It is the COMMANDITAIRE's responsibility to effectively manage this resource distribution, for which it can use the Provider's available tools for this purpose.

## 7.3. Service Limitations in the Qualified Bare Metal Model

### 7.3.1. Managed Services in RUN

It should be noted that the following are excluded from the Service:

- Hosting of the COMMANDITAIRE's physical components;

- The Tenant COMMANDITAIRE's network interconnection with the Internet or private networks, including operator links;

- Any managed service, or TMA;

- Any assistance on the installed operating systems and above in the responsibility stack, even if it's simple monitoring.

However, the COMMANDITAIRE may certainly use such services through the Provider's MSP offering to intervene in managed services mode on its Tenants. These services will not be governed by this Service Agreement and its bilateral clauses/commitments.

### 7.3.2. Backup Configuration

By default, the Provider provides the Bare Metal resources to the COMMANDITAIRE by reserving resources and configuring deployments to use Availability Zones. It is the COMMANDITAIRE's responsibility to choose the Availability Zones via the COMMANDITAIRE interface.

## 7.4. Service Implementation

### 7.4.1. Technical Requirements

For the implementation of the Service, the COMMANDITAIRE acknowledges that it will need to:

- Declare fixed IPs from which the Provider will authorize access to the COMMANDITAIRE interface (Whitelist filtering). Modifications to this IP list must be made via the designated menu in the console or through Service Requests for subsequent modifications. At service initialization, the Provider will have been informed of at least one IP address as described.

## 7.5. Service Location in France

It is specified that none of the operations or physical components involved in the provision of the Service, the subject of this Service Agreement, are located outside the European Union.

This includes, in particular, support, operational monitoring, and security monitoring (SOC) of the technical infrastructure delivering the Service. As a result, all storage, all administrative tasks, monitoring, and processing are performed in France.

### 7.5.1. Location of Datacenters Hosting the Service
In the absence of operations by the Provider's collaborators and agencies, all production operations (including data storage and processing) and technical components delivering the Service are located in Datacenters based in France.

### 7.5.2. Location of Cloud Temple agencies operating the service

The Cloud Temple collaborators involved in the Service's scope operate from Cloud Temple agencies all located exclusively in France. These agencies are located in France, in Tours, Lyon, Caen, and Paris La Défense.

The COMMANDITAIRE is informed of the possibility for Cloud Temple employees to work remotely. However, the Provider guarantees the same level of security regarding remote access, particularly concerning VPN access. These remote accesses are implemented in accordance with the requirements of the SecNumCloud reference framework.

## 7.6. Support

### 7.6.1. Nature of the support accompanying the service

The Provider offers a technical support service aimed at assisting the COMMANDITAIRE in managing, troubleshooting, and optimizing their deployed resources. This service covers a wide range of activities, from initial service configuration assistance to advanced technical support to resolve specific issues.

Here is a description of the characteristics and features of the support service:

- Initial implementation assistance for using the Service;
- Incident resolution assistance;
- Problem resolution assistance;
- Monitoring and advice on technical infrastructure optimization.

Within the scope of the support service, the Provider does not replace the COMMANDITAIRE in using the Service. The COMMANDITAIRE remains fully responsible for the configuration, operation of its VMs and Tenants, and the management of all elements (data and applications included) it has stored or installed on the Provider's infrastructure. The technical support service is provided in accordance with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use, with the Provider being subject to an obligation of means.

The COMMANDITAIRE commits to using the technical support service in a reasonable manner, refraining notably from requesting unsubscribed services from the Provider and from involving the Provider's teams with its own clients or third parties not included in the Contract. The Provider reserves the right to reject any service request that does not meet these criteria.

The level of support engagement is conditional upon the subscription of associated support work units.

### 7.6.2. Requesting the technical support service

Technical support is accessible via a ticketing system through the COMMANDITAIRE console and is available during normal business hours, excluding public holidays (8h - 18h; Monday to Friday; French calendar and hours). For emergencies occurring outside of working hours, particularly incidents significantly affecting production, the on-call service can be contacted via a number communicated to the COMMANDITAIRE at the initiation of the Service.

For each request or Incident, it is imperative to generate a ticket with the Provider's support. The initiation of this ticket, including all necessary information, is essential and marks the beginning of the evaluation of the Provider's commitments.

As soon as the Provider receives a request or an Incident notification, whether through the management console or following a phone call, a ticket is automatically created. When reporting an Incident, it is essential that the COMMANDITAIRE provides the Provider with as much detail as possible about the problem encountered. This step is crucial to enable an adequate assessment of the situation, its prioritization, and an effective diagnosis.

The COMMANDITAIRE then receives an email confirmation indicating the creation of the ticket and its unique number. The COMMANDITAIRE can check the status and history of its requests and Incident reports directly from the management console.

### 7.6.3. Incident management process

When an Incident is reported, the Provider's technical support team initiates an investigation to identify the cause of the problem and establish a diagnosis. The COMMANDITAIRE must actively collaborate with the Provider by providing all necessary information and performing the required tests. The Provider may access the COMMANDITAIRE's Service to diagnose the Incident.

If the Provider's Services are deemed functional and the Incident is not attributable to the Provider, the COMMANDITAIRE will be informed. At the COMMANDITAIRE's request, the Provider may offer Professional Services to identify the source of the problem, billable upon prior agreement in 30-minute increments.

In the case where the Incident is the responsibility of the Provider or one of its subcontractors, the Provider completes the diagnosis and works on restoring the Service without additional charges. The diagnosis is based on the exchanges between the Parties and the Provider's data, these elements being considered as evidence by mutual agreement.

### 7.6.4. Treatment prioritization process

The determination of the priority level of a case is based on a matrix analysis that evaluates the impact of the Incident and its level of criticality:

- Impact levels are defined as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact Level   Description
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact I1         The Provider's service(s) are interrupted

  Impact I2         The Provider's service(s) are degraded

Impact I3         The Provider's service(s) are currently stable, but show signs of potential long-term decline
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Criticality levels are defined as follows:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality Level   Description
  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Criticality C1          The Provider's service(s) are degrading at an alarming rate

  Criticality C2          The Provider's service(s) are deteriorating progressively over time

Criticality C3          The Provider's service(s) present one or more inconvenience without significant consequences
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Based on an in-depth analysis of the situation, taking into account the elements determining Impact and Criticality, a priority is assigned to the ticket according to the decision matrix below:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Impact Level  Criticality Level   Impact I1         Impact I2         Impact I3
  -------------------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  Criticality C1                           Priority **P1**   Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**

  Criticality C2                           Priority **P2**   Priority **P3**   Priority **P4**

Criticality C3                           Priority **P3**   Priority **P4**   Priority **P5**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The service level commitments corresponding to each priority level are detailed in the following chapter.

### 7.6.5. Language and location of the support service

The support is provided by the Provider to the COMMANDITAIRE in at least the French language. The support can also be provided in the English language.

The operations of the Provider's support service for the ongoing SecNumCloud-qualified Bare Metal service are located in the European Union.

# 8. Commitments and service levels

The Provider commits to ensuring continuous monitoring of the performance and security integrity of its technical infrastructure delivering the Service, ensuring its optimal operation.

The unavailability of a service, subject to a performance indicator, is recognized from its identification by the Provider's monitoring system, or following a notification by a COMMANDITAIRE user. The start of unavailability is set at the earliest of these two events to ensure accurate and fair calculation of the unavailability time.

The end of unavailability is officially marked by the complete restoration of the service, confirmed either by the Provider's monitoring tools or by user feedback, ensuring an effective resumption of operations and a faithful measurement of the downtime duration.

## 8.1. Infrastructure availability commitments

The Provider commits to maintaining an availability and performance level compliant with the standards defined for each specified period. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) apply provided that the COMMANDITAIRE implements its systems through at least two of the Availability Zones present in the relevant Region.
In the absence of compliance with these conditions by the COMMANDITAIRE, the latter will be unable to claim the application of the relevant SLAs, which are specifically identified by an asterisk (*). SLA accessibility is via the COMMANDITAIRE interface. The measurements are calculated monthly:

- **SLA 1 (*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-01** -- Compute power availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
- **SLA 2 (*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-02** -- Storage availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
- **SLA 3 (*) : IC-INFRA_SNC-03** -- Network infrastructure availability: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.
- **SLA 4 : IC-INFRA_SNC-04** -- Internet access: guaranteed availability rate of 99.99%, calculated on a 24/7 basis.

***Notes***:

- *In response to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the Provider reserves the right to adjust its internet routing configuration to limit the impact of the attack and protect its infrastructure. In particular, if an IP address belonging to the COMMANDITAIRE is targeted, the Provider may use the blackholing technique via the BGP community to block all traffic to the targeted IP address upstream with its suppliers, in order to protect the COMMANDITAIRE's resources as well as those of other COMMANDITAIREs and the Provider's infrastructure. The Provider strongly encourages the COMMANDITAIRE to adopt similar measures, such as using web application firewall software available on the market, and to carefully configure its security groups via the command API.*

- *The Provider emphasizes the necessity for the COMMANDITAIRE to minimize traffic openings, particularly by avoiding making administrative ports **SSH** (TCP port 22) and **RDP** (TCP port 3389) accessible from the entire Internet (subnet 0.0.0.0/0), as well as internal protocols such as **SMB** (TCP/UDP port 445) or **NFS** (TCP/UDP port 2049).*

## 8.2. Availability Commitment of the COMMANDITAIRE Interface

- SLA 5 : IC-INFRA_SNC-05 -- Access to the Service administration console: guaranteed availability of 97%, ensured continuously, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
- SLA 6 : IC-INFRA_SNC-06 -- Access to the Service control APIs: 99.9% availability, calculated on a 24/7 basis.

## 8.3. Availability Commitment of Support

- **SLA 7 : IC-INFRA_SNC-07** -- Here are the performance commitments of the Provider's technical support for incidents, excluding scheduled maintenance:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Priority          Guaranteed Time to Intervention (GTI)   Performance Target
  ----------------- ---------------------------------------- -------------------------
  Priority **P1**   30 minutes                                     95%

  Priority **P2**   2 hours                                        90%

  Priority **P3**   4 hours                                        90%

  Priority **P4**   24 hours                                       85%

Priority **P5**   48 hours                                       85%
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **SLA 8 : IC-INFRA_SNC-08** -- Here are the performance commitments of the Provider's technical support for service requests:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Guaranteed Time to Intervention (GTI)   Performance Target
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------------------------
  Service request      4 hours                                       90%

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note*:

- *The time for the Guaranteed Time to Intervention (GTI) is calculated from the difference between the moment the COMMANDITAIRE opens the ticket and the first intervention by the Provider's support.*
- *Investigation of incidents involving COMMANDITAIREs will not include remote intervention on the COMMANDITAIRE's hosted servers. This assistance will be limited to explaining the available metrics related to the COMMANDITAIRE's environment, to facilitate understanding of the incidents or performance issues encountered. Based on the results of this analysis, recommendations may be suggested.*
