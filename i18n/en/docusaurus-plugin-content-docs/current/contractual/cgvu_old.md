## 2. Preamble

These General Terms of Sale and Use (hereinafter referred to by the acronym "GTSU"), together with the annex titled Service Agreement, 
constitute a contract (hereinafter the " **Contract** ") established between Cloud Temple, a Simplified Joint Stock Company regulated by French law,

with its head office located at *Belvédère 1 – 7 cours Valmy Spaces, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as the " **Provider** "), 
and any entity, whether natural or legal person, acting as a consumer or professional, 
private or public law, having subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offer 
in accordance with the SecNumCloud Reference Framework (hereinafter referred to as the " **CLIENT** ").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Provider are respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and "Parties" when mentioned together.
It is specified that the terms used with a capital letter in this Contract are defined in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, titled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and stakeholders of the Contract, while respecting conventions and the precision required in legal language.

platform, accessible at the following address: https://www.cloud-temple.com.

In the presence of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained in the annex documents, priority will be given to the highest-ranking document.
The most recent and officially approved version of a document prevails over all its previous versions. Thus,
in case of discrepancy between one or more provisions within the same document, it is the subsequently validated version that will prevail.

The fact that a stipulation appearing in a lower-ranking document is not expressly mentioned in the higher-ranking document does not cause it to lose its legal value.

## 4. Purpose

The purpose of this Contract is to establish the terms and conditions under which the Service Provider agrees to provide the defined Services to the CLIENT, specifying the scope, the execution modalities of the Services, as well as the associated financial terms. The CLIENT commits to this contract in its own name and for its account.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms of Sale and Use (GTCS), which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in full. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is strongly recommended to seek the expertise of an IT and networking specialist before accepting these terms. This approach is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection of the proposed work units' characteristics and the determination of the resources necessary to meet its specific needs.

## 5. General Provisions

Each Party undertakes not to make any commitments on behalf of and for the account of the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract becomes invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, this provision will be considered unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract or the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Service Orders

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Service Provider, the CLIENT must have a valid **CLIENT Account**. In creating and managing this account, the CLIENT commits to providing the Service Provider with all data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, email address, identity and contact information, and relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and update of this information throughout the duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and assure the Service Provider that it holds the legal authority and capacity necessary to act on behalf of the CLIENT and to commit it in accordance with the provisions of the contract.

### 6.2. CLIENT Account Activation

Before activating the CLIENT Account, and at any time during the provision of services, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on its behalf. This verification can include requesting supporting documents for the communicated information. The Service Provider also reserves the right to refuse activation or to deactivate the CLIENT Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Once the CLIENT Account is activated by the Service Provider, the CLIENT can order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, orders may be placed through the dedicated CLIENT Management Interface. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management of its CLIENT Account, including securing authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered as made by the CLIENT itself and entails full acceptance of the Contract terms. The modalities and delivery times of the ordered Services vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after the Service Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the CLIENT to ensure that the conditions for providing the Services meet its requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. However, in case of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence will be given to the documents according to the order in which they have been listed. The annexes to the Contract, which provide technical details of the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Terms of Sale and Use (GTCS) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless a specific term is stipulated in the Specific Terms which would provide for a defined term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by following the modalities specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of its data stored under the Contract(s) concerned, in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Retrieval and Deletion".

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.
## 8. Périmètre des services

Le périmètre des services englobe spécifiquement :

- L'implémentation des services conformément au bon de commande,
- La provision de services d'infrastructure,
- La prestation additionnelle de services de Réversibilité.

L'accès à ces services, ainsi que leur utilisation, sont soumis aux termes et conditions établis dans le présent Contrat, y compris toutes ses annexes associées.

## 9. Services optionnels

Dans le cas où certains Services optionnels n'auraient pas été initialement inclus dans le Contrat, le CLIENT a la possibilité de les souscrire ultérieurement.
La fourniture de tout Service optionnel par le Prestataire est conditionnée à l'accord préalable des parties suite à une évaluation concertée.

## 10. Conditions d'utilisation des services

### 10.1. Respect des conditions de service

Le CLIENT s'oblige à passer commande et à utiliser les Services en respectant scrupuleusement les conditions d'utilisation applicables. 
L'utilisation des Services doit se faire de manière responsable. En particulier, le CLIENT s'engage à se familiariser avec les Conditions 
Générales de Vente et d'Utilisation (CGVU) en vigueur et à respecter toutes les directives qui lui sont fournies au moment de la commande. 

Lorsque le CLIENT utilise les Services pour le compte de tiers ou permet à des tiers d'accéder aux Services, il est tenu, avant toute utilisation
par ces derniers, de leur faire connaître et accepter les conditions d'utilisation actuelles. Le CLIENT assure ainsi le Prestataire du respect intégral 
de ces conditions par les tiers concernés.

### 10.2. Choix des services

Avant de procéder à la commande et à l'utilisation des Services, le CLIENT s'engage à examiner attentivement les Conditions d'utilisation actuelles, 
ainsi qu'à analyser en détail l'ensemble des documentations, configurations, options, et gammes de services proposées, ceci dans le but de choisir des Services et des caractéristiques 
qui correspondent précisément à ses besoins et à ceux des tiers utilisant les Services en son nom ou pour son compte. 

Le CLIENT veille particulièrement à ce que les Services sélectionnés soient conformes aux obligations légales et réglementaires inhérentes aux activités menées 
via l'utilisation des Services. Pour toute demande d'information relative aux Services, le CLIENT est invité à prendre contact avec le Prestataire. 
Il est de la responsabilité du CLIENT de se tenir informé des modifications susceptibles d'intervenir, notamment lors de l'émission de nouvelles Commandes.

### 10.3. Connexion 
L'accès aux Services requiert que le CLIENT dispose, à ses propres frais et sous sa responsabilité, d'une connexion à distance adéquate 
(telle qu'une connexion Internet ou un réseau privé). Il est porté à la connaissance du CLIENT que le réseau Internet peut subir des aléas techniques 
et présenter des risques de sécurité qui échappent aux mesures techniques déployées par le Prestataire dans le cadre des Services. 

Le Prestataire ne peut être tenu responsable des dysfonctionnements attribuables aux fournisseurs d'accès Internet ou à tout autre opérateur de réseau tiers 
(incluant, sans s'y limiter, les problèmes de fiabilité des connexions, les variations de bande passante, les interruptions de service, etc.), 
ni des répercussions éventuelles de ces dysfonctionnements, en particulier lorsqu'ils conduisent à une indisponibilité ou à une interruption des Services.

### 10.4. Moyens d'authentification

Le CLIENT assume l'entière responsabilité de la gestion et du maintien de la confidentialité des identifiants et mots de passe nécessaires 
pour accéder et utiliser les Services. Il doit veiller à ce que les utilisateurs autorisés soient pleinement informés et respectent les meilleures 
pratiques en matière de sécurité pour préserver la confidentialité de leurs moyens d'authentification. Le CLIENT est le seul responsable des conséquences 
découlant de la perte, de la divulgation ou de l'utilisation abusive ou non autorisée des moyens d'authentification attribués aux utilisateurs. 

En aucun cas, la responsabilité du Prestataire ne saurait être engagée pour de tels incidents. Le CLIENT s'engage à notifier sans délai le Prestataire 
en cas de perte ou de divulgation suspectée des moyens d'authentification, et à initier immédiatement les procédures de remplacement ou de réinitialisation de ces moyens.

### 10.5. Contenus

Dans le respect des dispositions fournies par le Prestataire, ce dernier ne participe pas activement à la gestion des contenus du CLIENT et s'abstient de tout accès à ces contenus, 
sauf dans le strict cadre nécessaire à la fourniture des Services. Ainsi, le Prestataire ne procède à aucune vérification, validation ou mise à jour des contenus mentionnés. 

De la même manière, il n'assure pas de sauvegarde dédiée des contenus stockés via les Services. Il incombe donc au CLIENT de prendre les dispositions adéquates pour 
la sauvegarde de ses contenus, afin de se protéger contre tout risque de perte ou de détérioration, quelle qu'en soit la raison, notamment via l'usage des unités d'œuvre appropriées dans le catalogue du Prestataire.

Les contenus gérés doivent être légaux et utilisés dans le respect des bonnes pratiques, ainsi que des lois et réglementations applicables. 
L'utilisation de contenus illicites (tels que la diffusion, la publication, le stockage ou la transmission de contenus faisant l'apologie de crimes, 
incitant à la haine ou à la violence contre des individus en raison de leur sexe, religion, orientation ou identité sexuelle, ou handicap, ou violant 
les droits de propriété intellectuelle d'autrui) est strictement interdite. 

Tout manquement à ces règles peut entraîner, à la discrétion du Prestataire, la suspension immédiate des Services, la désactivation du compte du CLIENT, 
voire la résiliation du Contrat aux torts exclusifs du CLIENT. Cela sans préjudice du droit du Prestataire à engager des poursuites judiciaires ou à réclamer des dommages-intérêts pour préjudice subi.

### 10.6. Respect des lois, réglementations et règles déontologiques

Les Services doivent être utilisés de manière responsable, en conformité avec les lois et réglementations applicables. Les Parties conviennent de rester attentives 
aux changements législatifs et réglementaires. Sont expressément interdites les pratiques suivantes, bien que cette énumération ne soit pas exhaustive : 

1. les usages abusifs ou frauduleux des Services et des ressources fournies, susceptibles de compromettre la stabilité et la sécurité des systèmes du Prestataire,
pouvant affecter la qualité des Services offerts aux autres utilisateurs ;
2. les tentatives d’intrusion ou d’attaque via les Services incluant, mais sans s'y limiter, le balayage de ports, l'écoute clandestine, 
le spoofing, ainsi que toute forme d'attaque émanant des ressources fournies, à l'exception des tests d’intrusion préalablement autorisés par le Prestataire ;
3. toute forme de SPAM ou pratiques similaires de « spamming » ; 
4. l'utilisation de contenus illicites ou interdits, tels que décrits précédemment dans la section « Contenus ».

### 10.7. Suspension de service

Le Prestataire se réserve le droit de suspendre temporairement ou totalement les Services en cas de : 

1. menace réelle pour la sécurité ou la stabilité des systèmes du Prestataire, des Services, ou des données CLIENT ; 
2. mise en œuvre des opérations de maintenance prévues ; 
3. requêtes d'autorités judiciaires ou administratives ; 
4. alertes reçues conformément à l'article 6 de la Loi pour la Confiance dans l'Économie Numérique (LCEN) ; 
5. violation des conditions d'utilisation établies par le Contrat. 

Cette suspension peut être immédiate, sans préavis, en cas de situation critique ou pour prévenir un usage illicite ou frauduleux des Services, 
une infraction aux droits de tiers, ou tout acte susceptible d'engager la responsabilité du Prestataire.
Le Prestataire s'efforce, dans la mesure du possible et sauf en cas de nécessité légale ou de violation des conditions d'utilisation, 
de minimiser l'impact de toute suspension sur le service habituel. Cependant, de telles suspensions n'exonèrent pas le CLIENT de son obligation de régler 
les montants dus au titre du Contrat. Le CLIENT reste informé des maintenances planifiées via une interface dédiée.

En cas de manquement du CLIENT à ses obligations, ces suspensions se feront sans préjudice du droit du Prestataire de résilier 
le Contrat ou de demander réparation. Sauf dans les cas de résiliation ou de non-renouvellement, les suspensions n'entraîneront pas 
la suppression des données CLIENT. À moins qu'elles ne soient exclusivement dues à un défaut du Prestataire, ces interruptions ne 
seront pas considérées comme une indisponibilité des Services aux fins des engagements de niveau de service stipulés dans le Contrat.

### 10.8. Evolution des services

Le Prestataire se réserve le droit d'apporter, à sa discrétion, toute modification aux Services, y compris l'ajout, la modification ou 
la suppression de gammes, d'options, de fonctionnalités, ainsi que l'amélioration de leurs performances. La description détaillée des Services 
est disponible sur le site internet du Prestataire. Il est de la responsabilité du CLIENT de rester informé des mises à jour des Services, 
lesquelles s'appliqueront immédiatement à toutes nouvelles commandes. Des changements peuvent aussi survenir de manière immédiate en réponse à des nécessités urgentes, 
telles que des risques sécuritaires ou des exigences de conformité légale ou réglementaire, ou encore suite à des modifications de produits tiers.

En conformité avec l'article « Conditions spécifiques aux Consommateurs », si une mise à jour entraine une dégradation d'un Service utilisé par le CLIENT — par exemple,
la suppression d'une fonctionnalité ou une baisse de performance —, le CLIENT a le droit de résilier le Service concerné. Pour ce faire, il doit envoyer une notification 

by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property 
of the Provider or its assignees. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance 
with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to note that, outside of these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that they choose to use or exploit within the scope of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits to not exploiting this content for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with current laws, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling any software, code, or algorithms provided within the scope of the Services, including attempts at reverse engineering, unless there is explicit legal authorization permitting to circumvent this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and restrictions related to the CLIENT's activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

If the CLIENT plans to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, it is the CLIENT's responsibility to ensure that such use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes but is not limited to compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 concerning the control of exports of dual-use items, as well as American regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including creditworthiness and the potential presence of the CLIENT on sanction lists such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, may be conducted. Following these verifications, the Provider can unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims any liability regarding Third-Party Products provided within the scope of the Services. These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranty related to these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the CLIENT's use of the Third-Party Products is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. In particular, it is forbidden for the CLIENT to decompile, gain access to source codes, or reinstall the Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. 
The responsibility for the use of the Third-Party Products rests entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for their specific needs and goals, while complying with the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The termination of the Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, the interruption of the Services by the CLIENT, the violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, result in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, broadcasted, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the scope of the Services, including potential backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (referred to here as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be performed after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved in the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, and their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior agreement from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations set forth in this article. The CLIENT agrees to ensure compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the CLIENT's responsibility. Penetration Tests must not in any case:

- Target other Provider infrastructures or services and/or Provider services not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising 
from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to make all necessary backups before the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in case of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, which may cause temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party impacted by this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, 
an audit report will be prepared and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of discovered vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Provider's written authorization. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge their obligation to collaborate. Consequently, they agree to communicate any information and document that may facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees that they possess the authority and capacity necessary to conclude the Contract and to fulfill their respective obligations. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee that they have all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (especially technical), allowing them to respectively use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions set forth in the Contract.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for

- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**_

In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent)
of the amount of the services concerned on the invoice of the month. Furthermore, the penalties always constitute a flat and definitive compensation for damages
concerning the incidents that gave rise to the penalties, these penalties having a liberating character.
