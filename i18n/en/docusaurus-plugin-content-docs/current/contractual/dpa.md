## Subcontractors

The Principal may need to engage one or more external contractors/suppliers for specific services covered under the Contract. In such cases, the Principal may recruit, at its discretion, a subcontractor of second tier solely for providing part of the necessary processing services for the managed system.

The Principal commits to entering into a legally binding agreement with any subsequent subcontractor engaged for data processing, ensuring adherence to GDPR requirements and imposing identical obligations as stipulated in Article 20.2. Specifically, the Principal must verify that the recruited subcontractor possesses sufficient safeguards for implementing necessary security measures.

In case of a subsequent subcontractor's failure to meet data protection obligations, the Principal remains fully accountable towards the Data Controller, irrespective of rights granted to affected individuals under Articles 79 and 82 of GDPR.

The authorized list of subsequent subcontractors is as follows:

- Interxion
- Data4
- Telehouse
- Iron Mountain

During contract execution, the Data Controller can request updates on this list from the Principal at any time. Regardless, the Principal will be notified in writing by the Subcontractor of regularly updated lists (except for major changes in subcontractors).

## Liability

The Data Processor and Subprocessor acknowledge that they may be held liable for damages resulting from non-conforming personal data processing in accordance with GDPR and applicable French law. The Subprocessor is responsible for damages caused by processing if it fails to meet the specific RGPD obligations applicable to subprocessors or acts outside of legally mandated instructions from the Data Controller or contrary to those instructions.

## Modifications

Any modification to this Annex must be subject to a written amendment signed by both parties. The modifications must comply with the GDPR and French data protection laws regarding personal data privacy.
