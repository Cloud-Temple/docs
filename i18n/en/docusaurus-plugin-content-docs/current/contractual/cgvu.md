## 4. Object

The present Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider commits to providing the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, execution modalities of the Services, and related financial terms. The CLIENT commits to this contract in his own name and on his behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance of the General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is strongly recommended that he seeks the expertise of an IT and network specialist before accepting these conditions. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, especially concerning the selection of the proposed work unit characteristics and the determination of the necessary resources to meet his specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party agrees not to make commitments on behalf of and for the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their staff.

In the event that a provision of the Contract is found to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, that provision will be considered unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the strength of its other provisions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. As part of creating and managing this account, the CLIENT agrees to provide the Provider with all necessary data for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, the email address, identity, and contact information, as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and ensure to the Provider that he holds the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind him according to the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account

Before activating the CLIENT Account, and at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on his behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents to back up the provided information. The Provider also has the right to refuse activation or proceed with deactivation of the CLIENT Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Once his CLIENT Account is activated by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, orders can be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for the management of his CLIENT Account, including securing the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT himself, and entails his full and entire adherence to the terms of the Contract. The terms and delivery times of the ordered Services vary according to the type of required Service. Certain Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the CLIENT to ensure that the Service provision conditions meet his requirements.

The constitutive documents of the Contract complement and interpret each other coherently. However, in case of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence will be given to the documents in the order in which they are listed. The annexes to the Contract, which detail the Services technically, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without undermining the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU) are concluded for an indefinite period unless otherwise stipulated in the Special Conditions which would provide for a fixed term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by complying with the terms specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of his data stored under the concerned Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Recovery and Deletion."

The cessation of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services
The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including all associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Agreement, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them later.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is conditioned upon the prior agreement of the parties following a collaborative assessment.

## 10. Terms of Use of Services

### 10.1. Compliance with terms of service

The CLIENT agrees to order and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use.
The use of Services must be responsible. In particular, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize themselves with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) and to abide by all guidelines provided at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use by those parties, to inform and have them accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thereby assures the Provider of full compliance with these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT agrees to carefully review the current Terms of Use, and to thoroughly analyze all documentation, configurations, options, and service ranges offered, to choose Services and features that precisely meet their needs and those of third parties using the Services on their behalf.

The CLIENT ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted via the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider.
It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed about potential changes, especially when new Orders are issued.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires the CLIENT to have, at their own expense and responsibility, a suitable remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical fluctuations and present security risks beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the scope of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for any consequences of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed of and adhere to best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

In no event shall the Provider be held liable for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to notify the Provider without delay in case of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication means and to immediately initiate replacement or reset procedures for these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's contents and refrains from any access to these contents, except within the strict scope necessary for the provision of Services. Thus, the Provider does not proceed with any verification, validation, or update of the mentioned contents.

Similarly, the Provider does not provide dedicated backup of the contents stored via the Services. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the CLIENT to take appropriate measures to back up their contents, to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, particularly through the use of appropriate units of work from the Provider's catalog.

The managed contents must be legal and used in accordance with best practices, as well as the applicable laws and regulations.
The use of illegal content (such as dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content advocating crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals based on their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the discretion of the Provider, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even termination of the Agreement to the exclusive fault of the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to take legal action or claim damages for a suffered harm.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services, including but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, and any form of attack originating from provided resources, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. all forms of SPAM or similar spamming practices;
4. the use of illegal or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Contents" section.

### 10.7. Service suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in case of:

1. real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with article 6 of the Trust in the Digital Economy Act (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Agreement.

This suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in cases of critical situations or to prevent unlawful or fraudulent use of Services, an infringement of the rights of third parties, or any act that could incur the Provider's liability.
The Provider endeavors, to the extent possible and unless legally required or in case of violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from the obligation to pay the amounts due under the Agreement. The CLIENT remains informed about planned maintenance through a dedicated interface.

In case of the CLIENT's non-compliance with their obligations, such suspensions will be without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Agreement or seek compensation. Unless in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are solely due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as unavailability of Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Agreement.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Provider reserves the right to make any modifications to the Services, at its discretion, including adding, modifying, or deleting ranges, options, or features, as well as improving their performance. A detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of Service updates, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications to third-party products.

In accordance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example, the removal of a feature or a performance downgrade — the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, they must send a notification.
de termination by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Right of Use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive
property of the Provider or its assigns. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements,
strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to note that,
apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements
and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) they choose to use or operate within the scope of the Services.

The CLIENT and its Users remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits not to exploit this content
for any purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with the laws in force, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software,
codes, and algorithms made available as part of the Services, including for attempts at reverse engineering, except where explicit legal authorization
allows bypassing this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's activities, the Provider
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union and in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, should they intend to use the Services or allow their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that such use
complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009,
on the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as with American regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations)
and the 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by US law.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order originating from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions,
or from physical or legal persons from these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including creditworthiness and the potential presence of the CLIENT
on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, may be conducted. Following these checks,
the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In line with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider declines all responsibility for the Third-Party Products provided within the framework of the Services.
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers
no warranty concerning these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to, any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the context of the Services provided. In particular, the CLIENT is prohibited from decompiling,
accessing the source codes, or reinstalling Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures.
Responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability to their specific needs and the objectives aimed at,
while complying with the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, non-renewal,
interruption of Services by the CLIENT, breach of the Contract terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations,
will result in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements)
that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, broadcast, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the context of the Services,
including possible backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Test

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services
(referred to here as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be carried out after signing an audit agreement by all parties involved
in providing the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, and their subcontractors where applicable.
These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior consent of users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms of carrying out these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor,
reproducing the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT undertakes to ensure compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility
of the CLIENT. Penetration Tests must in no way:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Provider's Services, infrastructures, and networks,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into the systems used by other clients is strictly forbidden. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising
from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups
before the tests to ensure the restoration of systems in case of an incident.

It should be noted that anti-spam mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others, will remain active during the tests, potentially causing
temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party impacted by this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests,
an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Provider upon request or if this is pertinent (for example, in case vulnerabilities are discovered).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential
and must not be published or shared without the written permission of the Provider. In case of breach of the established conditions, the Provider
reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge that they are subject to a duty of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to sharing
all information and documents likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more specifically, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees that they possess the necessary authority and capacity to enter into the Contract and fulfill their obligations under it. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee, in particular, that they have all the authorizations, competencies,
and knowledge (especially technical), allowing them respectively to use and provide the Services in accordance with the terms of the Contract.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as a lump-sum compensation for
any damage resulting from the failure to meet these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of claim, complaint, or action in this regard.
If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation attributable to the Provider is limited to the total of the amounts paid by the CLIENT
for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation claim.

**Liability Disclaimer Clause:** The Provider's liability shall not be engaged in the following cases:

- Improper use of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or CLIENT's negligence;
- Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decreased activity, reputational damage, loss of profits or clients, especially due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, third-party legal action, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or improper or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Conditions of Use", including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT’s needs (notably regarding the sensitivity of the concerned data);
- Security incidents related to internet use, especially in cases of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to the CLIENT's data or information on or from the internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT’s Responsibility 

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with their activities, including the usage of services provided by the Provider and compliance with the terms of the Contract.
This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- Ensuring that the chosen Services meet their requirements and those of any third parties using them on their behalf;
- Managing Content - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that they reproduce, host, install, collect, transmit, broadcast,
publish or use in any other way within the scope of the Services. This includes controlling, validating, updating, eliminating, backing up Content,
and implementing measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when this content belongs to third parties or is managed on their behalf;
- Complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any relevant code of ethics.
- Complying with PGSSI-S (general security policy for health information systems) if the service covered by this contract involves health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference framework.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, they commit to taking out civil liability insurance
with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages attributable to them. They also commit to maintaining
this insurance, or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage, active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party agrees to conduct its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases
the Provider from all liability and commits to protecting them against any consequences resulting from:

- The use or operation of illegal Content via the Services;
- Fraudulent or non-compliant use of the Services with prevailing regulations;
- Use of the Services infringing on third-party rights;
- The choice of Services unsuitable for the CLIENT's or third-party needs;
- The loss, unauthorized, or fraudulent use of User credentials.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in managing any request, complaint, or legal action involving Content
or the terms of the Contract, including those issued by administrative or judicial authorities, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for all
resulting damages, including any potential penalties, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

Under this Contract, the Provider does not assume any obligation toward third parties, including Users, and no clause
should be interpreted as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for interactions with third parties,
especially with Service Users, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for any third-party request, complaint, or action that might
question the quality or compliance of services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT is also obligated to inform the Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any third-party request, complaint, or action
regarding the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request along with all relevant information,
allowing the Provider to give the CLIENT the pertinent response elements or documents they possess.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of any obligation is suspended when its execution is prevented by a force majeure event as defined by article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, force majeure events will suspend the execution of the Contract. In case of force majeure preventing the Provider from performing its Services:

- Upon the occurrence of a force majeure event, Cloud Tempe will liaise with the CLIENT to jointly study solutions to ensure
the resumption of Services and mutually agree on the implementation terms of these solutions, which must occur no later than
forty-eight (48) hours after the date of the force majeure event;
- If its duration exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the force majeure event, or if the
Parties do not reach an agreement on the replacement solution before the expiration of the same period, the CLIENT may then entrust the Services,
covered by the Contract, to another Provider of their choice, thus initiating the Reversibility Phase as the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure event allow;
- Conversely, if the Provider is able, within a period of fewer than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the force majeure event,
to normally perform its obligations, the force majeure event having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the force majeure event persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, each party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the abovementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the force majeure event.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, as per the terms agreed upon
during the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing plans for its
Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options,
the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them when placing their order.

The mentioned prices are exclusive of tax for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant taxes (except for
taxes on the Provider's income) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional imposition does not constitute a price modification in the sense
of the article dedicated to the terms for price revision.

Unless otherwise specified, the cost of Services also includes fees related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights
of the tools, software, and operating systems used by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT within the scope of the Services.
It is the CLIENT’s responsibility to obtain and pay for any necessary license or usage rights for the operation of the content they use via the Services.

The price structure for Services and the units of measurement used for the calculation of these prices are available on the Provider's website.
It is recommended that the CLIENT consults this information before confirming their order. Any begun unit of measurement is due in its entirety,
even if not fully consumed. Additionally, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or activation.

### 14.2. Price Changes 

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any tariff changes will apply immediately to Orders placed after
the modification. For already subscribed Services, any rate increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a thirty (30) calendar days’ notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the opportunity, within thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties.
This termination can be done either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface.
If termination is not completed within this period, the CLIENT will be considered to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option
to terminate without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by article 1195 of the Civil Code.
In such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing 

The billing of Services is carried out based on actual use and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system,
which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of a dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annually, or on another basis) as well as the
timing (upon order or after delivery) vary depending on the Service concerned. Billing terms are determined according to the technical and commercial offer

approved by the CLIENT and the Service Provider. Any started period is due on a pro-rata basis. It is the CLIENT’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with these terms before placing an order.
After the payment of each invoice, the Service Provider sends the CLIENT proof of payment.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which will be sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT.
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each received invoice, in accordance with the prevailing legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and late payment

Unless contested in good faith by the CLIENT concerning all or part of the invoice, in case of default or delay in payment, including partial payment,
the following consequences will apply:

1. late payment penalties will be immediately payable from the day following the due date, calculated based on an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any late or default payment (even partial) of the amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after the sending
of a default notification by email, will automatically result, without further notification or formality:

- the immediate enforceability of all amounts still due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- the right for the Service Provider to immediately and without notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for),
to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

Additionally, in case of delay or default in payment, professional clients are required to pay a flat indemnity of forty (40) euros for collection costs,
without prejudice to the right of the Service Provider to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of proofs, if the incurred collection costs exceed this flat amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute regarding billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Service Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT Management Interface,
within a maximum period of one (1) month following the invoice issuance date. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any potential future contestation of the invoice,
obliged to pay the due amounts in accordance with the Contract terms. In the event of a billing error, the Service Provider reserves
the right to make the necessary adjustments to the concerned invoices, within the applicable statute of limitations.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to meet the Service Levels in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement gives the CLIENT the right to apply penalties.
The application of penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the generating event.
In the case of a failure that is the responsibility of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty will be applicable to the Service Provider.

Penalties will be calculated in relation to the non-compliant reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot
exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the Services' amounts concerned from the invoice of the month. When the application of penalties is requested by the CLIENT, the payment
of these penalties by the Service Provider will constitute a final lump-sum indemnity for damages concerning the incidents that gave rise to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties

**Penalties = Percentage deviation between the promised availability by SLA of the considered Service over the calculation period and the observed availability of the considered service over the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLA 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet access 99.9%; current month's rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_

In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent)
of the concerned services' amounts on the invoice of the month. Additionally, penalties always constitute a final lump-sum indemnity for damages
concerning the incidents that gave rise to the penalties, with these penalties being of a liberating nature.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit on the amount of the Regular Service the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract,
regardless of the reason, the Service Provider will pay the remaining amount to the CLIENT via bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for convenience

The CLIENT is allowed to terminate the Contract, without justification and at no cost, after a period of one (1) month following the activation of the Contract.
To do so, they must notify the termination by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Service Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. Termination takes effect at the end of this period. Services provided by the Service Provider until the effective
termination date will be billed according to the Contract terms, with no additional indemnity. However, the CLIENT remains responsible for paying
the remaining amounts for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for breach

In the event of non-compliance by either party with their essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party
a notice of default by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) working days from the notification receipt to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the defaulting party has not rectified their breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to terminate the Contract by sending
another notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation
to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the suffered losses.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach implicates the liability of the party initiating this process. In the event that it is established
that the targeted party did not, in fact, fail to meet their obligations, the party who initiated the termination procedure will be held
responsible for compensating the damages suffered by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In case of bankruptcy of the other party, unless the court-appointed administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal term.
2. If there is a change of control within the other party, as per Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the invoking party.
3. Failure to perform the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to force majeure.
4. An unforeseeable change in circumstances at the time of Contract signing, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The CLIENT's repeated and unfounded use of the liability clause, placing the Service Provider in a financially adverse situation or rendering the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or termination of the Contract for any reason:

- The CLIENT is allowed to initiate the reversibility phase as described in the "Reversibility" article;
- The Service Provider is obligated to ensure the secure deletion of all the final CLIENT's data.

- This deletion implies a secure erasure of all media containing these data, following the provisions of the Service Agreement.
Upon the conclusion of a Contract, regardless of the reason, the Service Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated
with the final CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configurations.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (i.e., aiding the Client in migrating their system to another Service Provider) except for the provision of the technical interface and APIs
enabling the CLIENT to back up and recover their data, including configuration data for platforms,
via one of the following technical methods at the CLIENT's choice: provision of files in one or more documented and usable formats outside the Service Provider’s service or setting up technical interfaces allowing
data access following a documented and usable scheme (API).

The CLIENT, solely responsible for their System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation if necessary
(which includes, notably, creating a rigorous documentation for this purpose) and developing Reversibility plans. If the CLIENT requires an additional service, the Service Provider can propose a

mission of consulting in this regard under a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract,
is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, all information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological,
commercial, social, financial, legal, or any other domain data, whether they are patentable or not.
Among this information, there are plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports,
forecasts of needs, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, customer or partner names.

These Confidential Informations may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of their form (oral, written),
the type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To reinforce their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed to the communication media.
- A confidentiality reminder will systematically be given at each exchange, with indication of the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect the confidential nature of the information nor the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already public without fault of the receiving Party;
- Was known to the receiving Party before communication by the issuer, as evidenced by the archives of the receiving Party;
- Is legitimately received from a third party without restriction on confidentiality;
- Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

The Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used only for the execution of the Contract. The Parties undertake to:

- Use the Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of the Confidential Information to team members involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the content of the Contract;
- Not disclose the Confidential Information to third parties without the prior written consent of the other Party, except legal or judicial necessity;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information by keeping it in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for their security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in effect during the term of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination.
At the end of the Contract, the Parties undertake to return or destroy all the Confidential Information, without retaining any copies, unless otherwise instructed by the issuing Party.

The Service Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Service Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of law n° 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, related to subcontracting,
and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any breach of the obligations set forth by said law.
The use of Subcontractors, in no way reduces the responsibility of the Service Provider to the CLIENT under the Contract, the Service Provider
remaining fully liable for the performance of the Subcontracted Services vis-à-vis the CLIENT and, generally, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, neither Party may assign the Contract,
in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, especially in the event of a change of control
(within the meaning of articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset contribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group provided that it informs
the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## 21. Labor law regulation

The Service Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 and following, L. 8254-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of articles L. 8251-1 and following the Labor Code,

stipulations of decree n° 92-158 of February 20, 1992, establishing the specific hygiene and safety requirements applicable to work carried out in an establishment
by an external company (art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Parties will inform each other of any possible difficulties in this regard and the means to remedy them. The Contract excludes any notion of
provision of staff within the framework of the regulation on temporary work.

The Service Provider's staff remains at all times under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Service Provider, which alone has the authority to direct and control its employees.
The CLIENT may not give orders directly to the Service Provider’s staff and/or the staff of the Service Provider’s potential subcontractors.

The Service Provider assumes responsibility for its staff’s affiliation with all social organizations and full compliance with labor legislation.
As such, the Service Provider certifies that it has made the declarations required by the social protection organizations and has not resorted to concealed work as defined in
articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. In the event that the Service Provider uses a subcontractor, it undertakes to ensure that the latter strictly complies with the
above-legal stipulations.

In accordance with the legal provisions on the prevention and suppression of concealed work, the Service Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT at the date of signing the Contract and every six (6) months until the end of its execution:

- Elimination of all discrimination, whether based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, national minority status or any other condition, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions;
- Fighting corruption in all its forms, ensuring complete integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider firmly commits to honoring and promoting the fundamental values of the European Union, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality,
respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights including those of minorities. This commitment translates into constant vigilance and action to ensure
that these principles are respected at all levels of their activity.

## 23. Intellectual property

This Contract does not constitute any transfer or assignment of intellectual and/or industrial property rights, including patents. It is expressly forbidden for the CLIENT to:

- Copy or reproduce in any way the elements used for the service provision, including but not limited to computer code, texts, images, designs, graphic charters, ergonomics, documentation, etc.

Malgré ces restrictions, the Provider grants the CLIENT a personal, non-transferable, and non-exclusive right to use the aforementioned elements, solely within the necessary scope of utilizing the Services
and for the duration of these services. This usage authorization automatically expires with the end of service provision.

## 24. Non-solicitation of personnel

Unless with prior written agreement, each Party waives the right to hire or directly or indirectly employ any member of the other Party’s staff
for the duration of the Contract increased by a period of one (1) year from its termination date.

Any violation by one of the Parties of the above obligation will automatically result in the offending Party paying a fixed and
liberating indemnity set at twelve (12) months of gross salary (fixed and variable salary) of the staff member concerned.

The reference average salary for calculating the indemnity amount is that of the last 3 months preceding the termination date of the employment contract.

## 25. Distinctive signs of the parties

Each Party is prohibited from any conduct and any act likely to harm directly or indirectly the distinctive signs of the other Party, particularly its trademarks.
Without prejudice to the Provider citing the CLIENT as a reference and for the CLIENT to mention that they are using the Provider's Services. However, each Party,
without having to justify it, may notify the other Party to no longer cite it.
