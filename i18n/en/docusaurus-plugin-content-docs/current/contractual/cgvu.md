7 cours Valmy Spaces, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as
the "**Provider**"), and any entity, whether a natural or legal person,
acting as a consumer or professional, under private or public law, having
subscribed to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offer in compliance with the
SecNumCloud Referential (hereinafter referred to as the "**
CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Provider are
respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and
"Parties" when mentioned jointly. It is specified that the terms used
with a capital letter in this Contract are defined in accordance with the
provisions of Article 1, titled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and
stakeholders of the Contract, while respecting the conventions and the
precision required in legal language.

**IT IS HEREBY RECALLED THAT**

The Provider positions itself as a specialized operator in the field of
Cloud Computing, offering notably Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), as well as Professional Services.

All services offered by Cloud Temple are available globally for clients
who subscribe to the offers presented on their online platform, accessible
at the following address: https://www.cloud-temple.com.

In the event of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained
in the appendices, precedence will be given to the hierarchically superior
document. The most recent and officially approved version of a document
takes precedence over all its previous versions. Thus, in the event of a
discrepancy between one or more provisions within the same document, it
is the subsequently validated version that will prevail.

The fact that a stipulation in a lower-ranked document is not expressly
mentioned in the higher-ranked document will not deprive it of its legal
value.

## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider commits to providing the CUSTOMER with the defined Services, specifying the scope, execution modalities of the Services, and the associated financial terms. The CUSTOMER engages in this contract on its behalf.

The CUSTOMER's adherence to this contract implies unreserved acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (T&Cs), which the CUSTOMER declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Even though the CUSTOMER operates as a professional, it is strongly advised to seek the expertise of an IT and network specialist before accepting these conditions. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the Contract's technical aspects, particularly about selecting the proposed work units' characteristics and determining the resources required to meet its specific needs.

## 5. General Provisions

Each Party commits not to make commitments on behalf of the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and their personnel's actions.

If a provision of the Contract is found invalid under applicable legislation or an irrevocable court decision, that provision will be considered unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the strength of the other provisions.

## 6. Service Order

### 6.1. CUSTOMER Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CUSTOMER to have a valid **CUSTOMER Account**. In the context of creating and managing this account, the CUSTOMER commits to providing the Provider with all data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, email address, identity and contact information, and relevant banking details. The CUSTOMER guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information throughout the Contract duration.

If the CUSTOMER Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CUSTOMER, such third party must attest and ensure the Provider that it holds the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CUSTOMER and bind it according to the contract provisions.

### 6.2. Activation of the CUSTOMER Account

Before the activation of the CUSTOMER Account, and at any time during the service provision, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CUSTOMER or on their behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents for the communicated information. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or deactivate the CUSTOMER Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon the Provider's activation of their CUSTOMER Account, the CUSTOMER may order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services, orders may be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CUSTOMER. The CUSTOMER assumes full responsibility for managing their CUSTOMER Account, including securing the associated authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.).

Any order placed from the CUSTOMER Account is considered to have been
performed by the CLIENT himself, and constitutes his full and complete
adherence to the terms of the Contract. The terms and timing for making
the ordered Services available vary depending on the type of Service
required. Some Services will only be available after the Service
Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the
CLIENT's responsibility to ensure that the conditions for providing the
Services meet his requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and are interpreted
coherently with each other. However, in case of contradiction or
discrepancies between them, precedence will be given to the documents in
the order in which they were listed. The annexes to the Contract, which
technically detail the Services, shall not conflict with the principles
set forth in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide
technical precision without calling into question the general provisions
of the document.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale
and Use (GTCSU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise
provided in the Special Conditions which would specify a fixed term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible in accordance with the
provisions specified in the "Termination" section. Before any
termination, the CLIENT must ensure the full recovery of his data that
was stored under the applicable Contract(s), in accordance with the
provisions of the section related to "Data Retrieval and Deletion".

Termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider
or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay for
the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the order form,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services and their use are subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Contract, including all its associated
annexes.

## 9. Optional services

If certain Optional Services were not initially included in the
Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them later.
Provision of any Optional Service by the Service Provider is subject to
the prior agreement of the parties following a joint evaluation.

## 10. Conditions of use of the services

### 10.1. Compliance with service terms

The CLIENT agrees to place orders and use the Services in strict
compliance with the applicable terms of use. Use of the Services must be
done responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize
himself with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use
(GTCSU) and to comply with all guidelines provided to him at the time of
order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows
third parties to access the Services, he is obligated, prior to any use
by such third parties, to inform them and obtain their acceptance of the
current terms of use. The CLIENT thus ensures the Service Provider of
complete compliance with these terms by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Selection of services

Before placing an order and using the Services, the CLIENT agrees to
carefully review the current Terms of Use, as well as to analyze in
detail all documentations, configurations, options, and ranges of
services offered, in order to select Services and features that
precisely match his needs and those of third parties using the Services
on his behalf or for his benefit.

The CLIENT ensures in particular that the selected Services comply with
the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities carried
out through the use of the Services. For any information request
regarding the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Service
Provider. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of any
potential changes, especially when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Accessing the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at his own expense
and responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet
connection or private network). It is brought to the CLIENT's attention
that the Internet network may experience technical fluctuations and
present security risks beyond the technical measures deployed by the
Service Provider in connection with the Services.

The Service Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions
attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party
network operators (including, but not limited to, connection reliability
issues, bandwidth fluctuations, service interruptions, etc.), nor the
potential repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they
lead to unavailability or interruption of Services.

### 10.4. Authentication means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the
confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and
use the Services. He must ensure that authorized users are fully
informed and comply with the best security practices to preserve the
confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely
responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or
misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to the
users.

In no event shall the Service Provider's liability be engaged for such
incidents. The CLIENT agrees to immediately notify the Service Provider
in the event of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication
means, and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or
resetting these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Service Provider, the
latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's
contents and refrains from any access to these contents, except within
the strict framework necessary for providing the Services. Thus, the
Service Provider does not carry out any verification, validation, or
update of the mentioned contents.

Similarly, it does not ensure dedicated backup of the contents stored
via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take
appropriate measures for backing up his contents, to protect against any
risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason may be, including
through the use of appropriate units in the Service Provider's catalog.

The managed contents must be legal and used in compliance with good
practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of
illegal content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or
transmission of content glorifying crimes, inciting hatred or violence
against individuals due to their gender, religion, sexual orientation or
identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights
of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any violation of these rules may result, at the Service Provider's
discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, the
deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even the termination of the
Contract at the CLIENT's sole fault. This is without prejudice to the
Service Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages
for suffered harm.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to
legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are
expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abuse or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources,
   likely to compromise the stability and security of the Service
   Provider's systems, which may affect the quality of Services offered
   to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services, including but not
   limited to port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any
   form of attack originating from the provided resources, except for
   penetration tests previously authorized by the Service Provider;
3. Any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. The use of illegal or prohibited content, as previously described in
   the "Contents" section.

### 10.7. Service suspension

The Service Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely
suspend the Services in case of:

1. A real threat to the security or stability of the Service Provider's
   systems, the Services, or CLIENT data;
2. Implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. Requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. Alerts received under article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the
   Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. Violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension can be immediate without notice in case of a critical
situation or to prevent illegal or fraudulent use of the Services, a
violation of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the Service
Provider's liability. The Service Provider strives, as far as possible
and except in case of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to
minimize the impact of any suspension on regular service. However, such
suspensions do not exempt

pas le CLIENT de son obligation de régler les montants dus au titre du
Contrat. Le CLIENT reste informé des maintenances planifiées via une
interface dédiée.

In the event of the CLIENT failing to meet their obligations, these suspensions will be without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, the suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as an unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Evolution des services

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any changes to the Services, including the addition, modification, or removal of ranges, options, features, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed about the updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks, legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or due to changes in third-party products.

In compliance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT --- for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance ---, the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, they must send a termination notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within a period of sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Propriété intellectuelle et droit d'utilisation

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider --- including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others --- remain the exclusive property of the Provider or its assignees. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all the necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and contents (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) they choose to use or exploit within the scope of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits not to exploit this content for any purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is obliged not to decompile the software, codes, and algorithms made available within the scope of the Services, including for reverse engineering attempts, except for explicit legal authorization allowing bypassing this restriction.

### 10.10. Contrôle à l'exportation

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and restrictions related to the CLIENT's activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if they intend to use the Services or permit their use by third parties outside the European borders, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 of May 5, 2009, on the control of exports of dual-use items, as well as US regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), as the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by US legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities from those countries or under sanctions. Checks, including creditworthiness and the potential presence of the CLIENT on sanction lists, such as the asset freeze list of the Directorate General of the Treasury, may be carried out. Following these checks, the Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Produits tiers

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1.  the Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party Products provided within the scope of the Services. These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility, or stability issues. The Provider offers no warranty regarding these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to any related information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2.  the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the provided Services. It is particularly forbidden for the CLIENT to decompile, gain access to source codes, or reinstall Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for using Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for their specific needs and objectives, while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuité et réversibilité des services

The cessation of the Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, non-renewal, interruption of the Services by the CLIENT, violation of the Contract terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, entails the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Contents (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the scope of the Services, including any backups.

### 10.13. Test d'intrusion

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically appointed external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (referred to here as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be performed after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved in providing the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, and their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior agreement from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The conditions for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, reiterating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the CLIENT's responsibility. The Penetration Tests must in no case:

-   Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
-   Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Provider,
-   Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Penetration Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, potentially resulting in temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform all affected parties of this unavailability. At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be prepared and made available to the Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (e.g., in the case of discovered vulnerabilities).

This audit report, its contents, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Provider's written permission. In case of a violation of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge their obligation to collaborate. Accordingly, they commit to communicating any information and documents likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Responsabilité

### 12.1. Capacité

Each of the Parties declares and guarantees possessing the authority and capacity necessary to conclude the Contract and execute the obligations incumbent upon them. The CLIENT and the Provider declare and guarantee, in particular, that they have all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (especially technical), enabling them respectively to use and provide the Services in accordance with the terms set out in the Contract.

### 12.2. Responsabilité du Prestataire
Lorsque le Contrat stipulates service level commitments, penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as lump-sum compensation for any harm resulting from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of request, claim, or action on this basis. If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum compensation payable by the Provider is limited to the total amount paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation claim.

**Exclusion of Liability Clause:** The Provider's liability cannot be incurred in the following cases:

-   Misuse of services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
-   Non-performance, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of the services due to a third party (other than the Provider's subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third product, or CLIENT negligence;
-   Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decrease in activity, damage to reputation, loss of profits or clients, especially caused by the accidental disclosure of confidential information, a third-party lawsuit, etc.;
-   Loss, disclosure, or improper or fraudulent use of users' access credentials attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
-   Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Conditions of use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
-   Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, to the extent that the Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;
-   Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly concerning the sensitivity of the data in question);
-   Security incidents related to the use of the internet, especially in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to CLIENT data or information on or from the internet network;
-   Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT's Responsibility

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

-   ensuring that the chosen Services meet its requirements and those of any third party using them on its behalf;
-   managing Content - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., that it reproduces, hosts, installs, collects, transmits, broadcasts, publishes, or uses in any other way as part of the Services. This includes the control, validation, updating, deletion, backup of Content, and the implementation of measures to prevent their loss or alteration, even when this content belongs to or is managed on behalf of third parties;
-   complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any applicable code of ethics.
-   complying with the PGSSI-S (general policy on health information system security) if the service covered by this contract involves health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference framework.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, it agrees to subscribe to civil liability insurance with a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that could be attributed to it. It also agrees to maintain this insurance or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage active throughout the duration of the Contract.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party agrees to conduct its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases the Provider from any liability and agrees to protect it against any consequence arising from:

-   the use or exploitation of illegal Content through the Services;
-   fraudulent or non-compliant use of the Services under the applicable regulations;
-   the exploitation of the Services infringing the rights of third parties;
-   the choice of Services unsuitable for the CLIENT's needs or those of third parties;
-   the loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User credentials.

The CLIENT also agrees to actively participate in the management of any request, claim, or legal action involving the Content or the terms of the Contract, including those from administrative or judicial authorities, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for any resulting damages, including any judgments, as well as justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

Under this Contract, the Provider assumes no obligation to third parties, including Users, and no clause should be construed as granting beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, especially with Users of the Services, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for any third-party request, claim, or action that could question the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT also agrees to inform the Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any third-party request, claim, or action concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request and all relevant information allowing the Provider to provide the CLIENT with the response elements or useful documents it holds.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of any obligation is suspended when its execution is prevented by a force majeure event as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, force majeure events will suspend the execution of the Contract. In case of force majeure preventing the Provider from performing its Services:

-   As soon as the event constituting force majeure occurs, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to jointly study solutions to ensure the resumption of Services and agree on the implementation modalities of these solutions, which must be implemented no later than forty-eight (48) hours after the date of the force majeure event;
-   If the duration of the latter exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the force majeure event, or if the Parties cannot agree on the replacement solution at the latest by the end of the same period, the CLIENT may then entrust the Services covered by the Contract to another Provider of its choice, thus initiating the Reversibility Phase as far as the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure event permit;
-   Conversely, if the Provider manages to perform its obligations normally within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the force majeure event, the force majeure ceasing, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the force majeure event persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, either party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the force majeure event.

## 14. Financial Terms

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of issuing the invoice, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon when signing the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing plans for its Services, which may include, as applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a specific billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them when placing their order.

The mentioned prices are excluding taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other applicable tax (except for the Provider's income taxes) are added to the billed amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price modification within the meaning of the article dedicated to the conditions for rate revision.

Unless otherwise specified, the cost of the Services also includes fees related to the acquisition of licenses and rights to use tools, software, and operating systems employed by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT as part of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any license or right to use necessary for exploiting the content they use via the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used to calculate these prices are available on the Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult these details before confirming their order. Any unit of measurement started is due.
son intégralité, même si elle n'est pas entièrement consommée. De plus,
certains Services peuvent engendrer des coûts supplémentaires pour leur
installation ou leur mise en service.

### 14.2. Changement de prix

Le Prestataire se réserve le droit de réviser ses tarifs à sa
discrétion. Toute modification tarifaire s'appliquera immédiatement aux
Commandes passées postérieurement à cette modification. Pour les
Services déjà souscrits, toute hausse tarifaire sera communiquée au
CLIENT avec un préavis de trente (30) jours calendaires via courriel.

Suite à cette notification, le CLIENT aura la possibilité, durant trente
(30) jours calendaires, de résilier les Services concernés sans encourir
de pénalités. Cette résiliation peut être effectuée soit par envoi d'un
courrier recommandé avec accusé de réception, soit via un formulaire
spécifique disponible dans l'Interface de Gestion du CLIENT. En
l'absence de résiliation dans ce délai, le CLIENT sera considéré comme
ayant accepté les nouveaux prix. Il est important de noter que l'option
de résiliation sans pénalités n'est pas offerte dans les situations où
l'augmentation des prix découle de circonstances imprévues, telles que
définies par l'article 1195 du Code civil. Dans de telles circonstances,
les termes spécifiés dans ledit article s'appliqueront.

### 14.3. Facturation

La facturation des Services est effectuée en fonction de l'utilisation
réelle et des Commandes passées par le CLIENT, telles enregistrées dans
le système d'information du Prestataire, qui est considéré comme fiable
et fait autorité en cas de différend avec le CLIENT. La fréquence de
facturation (mensuelle, annuelle, ou selon une autre périodicité) ainsi
que le timing (à la commande ou après livraison) diffèrent selon le
Service concerné. Les modalités de facturation sont déterminées
conformément à l'offre technique et commerciale validée par le CLIENT et
le Prestataire. Toute période entamée est due au prorata de la période.
Il est de la responsabilité du CLIENT de se familiariser avec ces
conditions avant de procéder à une commande. Suite au règlement de
chaque facture, le Prestataire envoie au CLIENT un justificatif de
paiement.

Le CLIENT accepte de manière explicite la réception des factures par
voie électronique, celles-ci étant envoyées à l'adresse courriel fournie
par le CLIENT. Il incombe au CLIENT de sauvegarder une copie de chaque
facture reçue, en accord avec les exigences légales en vigueur.

### 14.4. Défaut et retard de paiement

Sauf contestation de bonne foi par le CLIENT concernant tout ou partie
de la facture, en cas de manquement ou de retard dans le paiement, y
compris un paiement partiel, les conséquences suivantes s'appliqueront :

1.  des pénalités de retard seront immédiatement exigibles dès le
    lendemain de la date d'échéance, calculées sur la base d'un taux
    d'intérêt équivalent à trois fois le taux légal,
2.  tout retard ou défaut de paiement (même partiel) des sommes dues par
    le CLIENT en vertu du Contrat, persistant plus de sept (7) jours
    calendaires après l'envoi d'une notification de défaut de paiement
    par courriel, entraînera automatiquement sans autre notification ni
    formalité :

-   l'exigibilité immédiate de l'intégralité des sommes restant dues par
    le CLIENT au titre du Contrat, quel que soit le mode de paiement
    initialement convenu,
-   le droit pour le Prestataire de suspendre immédiatement et sans
    préavis l'ensemble ou une partie des Services fournis au CLIENT (y
    compris ceux déjà payés), de refuser toute nouvelle Commande ou
    renouvellement de Services, et de procéder à la résiliation
    unilatérale du Contrat, en totalité ou en partie, par courriel.

De plus, en cas de retard ou défaut de paiement, les clients
professionnels sont tenus de verser une indemnité forfaitaire de
quarante (40) euros pour frais de recouvrement, sans préjudice du droit
pour le Prestataire d'exiger une indemnisation supplémentaire, sur
présentation de justificatifs, si les frais de recouvrement engagés
dépassent ce montant forfaitaire.

### 14.5. Contestation

Tout litige relatif à la facturation ou aux spécificités des Services
doit être soumis au Service CLIENT du Prestataire via l'Interface de
gestion du CLIENT, dans un délai maximum d'un (1) mois suivant la date
d'émission de la facture. Passé ce délai, le CLIENT reste, malgré toute
contestation future éventuelle de la facture, obligé de régler les
montants dus conformément aux termes du Contrat. Dans l'éventualité où
une erreur de facturation serait constatée, le Prestataire se réserve le
droit d'effectuer les ajustements nécessaires sur les factures
concernées, et ce, dans le respect des délais de prescription
applicables.

## 15. Pénalités

### 15.1. Principe

Le non-respect des Niveaux de Services visés dans la Convention de
Services SecNumCloud donne au CLIENT le droit d'appliquer des pénalités.
L'application des pénalités sera demandée par le CLIENT par e-mail dans
un délai maximal de 90 (quatre-vingt-dix) jours après l'effet
générateur. Dans le cas d'un manquement qui ne serait pas de la
responsabilité du Prestataire, mais du CLIENT ou d'un Tiers, aucune
pénalité ne sera applicable au Prestataire.

Les pénalités seront calculées par rapport à l'indicateur de référence
non respecté. En tout état de cause, le montant total des pénalités
mensuelles ne peut excéder de 30 % (trente pour cent) du montant des
Services concernés de la facture du mois. Lorsque l'application des
pénalités est demandée par le CLIENT, le paiement de ces pénalités par
le Prestataire constituera une indemnité forfaitaire et définitive de
dommages intérêts pour ce qui concerne les incidents à l'origine de la
pénalité.

### 15.2. Calcul des pénalités

**Pénalités = Ecart en pourcentage entre la disponibilité promise par
SLA du Service considéré sur la période de calcul et la disponibilité
constatée du service considéré sur la période de calcul.**

***Exemple : Non-respect des SLA 1 -- 3 et 4***

-   *SLA 1 : IC-INFRA_SNC-01 -- Disponibilité Compute : 99,9%;taux du
    mois en cours 90%; taux de pénalité à appliquer **9,9%***
-   *SLA 3 : IC-INFRA_SNC-03 -- Sauvegarde : 99,9%; taux du mois en
    cours 80%; taux de pénalité à appliquer **19,9%***
-   *SLA 4 : IC-INFRA-SNC-05 -- Accès internet 99,9%; taux du mois en
    cours 90%; taux de pénalité à appliquer **9,9%***

En tout état de cause, toutes les pénalités dans le cadre des présents
Conditions Générales de Vente et Utilisation ne peuvent excéder 30 %
(trente pour cent) du montant des services concernés de la facture du
mois. En outre, les pénalités constituent toujours une indemnité
forfaitaire et définitive de dommages-intérêts pour ce qui concerne les
incidents à l'origine des pénalités, ces pénalités ayant un caractère
libératoire.

Les pénalités seront appliquées sous forme d'un crédit du montant du
Service Régulier le mois suivant. Si des pénalités restent dues à la fin
du Contrat quelle qu'en soit la cause, le Prestataire paiera le reliquat
au CLIENT par versement bancaire.

## 16. Résiliation

### 16.1. Résiliation par convenance

Le CLIENT est autorisé à mettre fin au Contrat, sans avoir à justifier
sa décision ni encourir de pénalités, une fois écoulé un délai d'un (1)
mois suivant l'activation du Contrat. Pour ce faire, il doit notifier sa
résolution par lettre recommandée avec demande d'avis de réception
adressée au Prestataire.

Un préavis de deux (2) mois est requis. La résiliation prend effet à
l'issue de cette période. Les services fournis par le Prestataire
jusqu'à la date effective de résiliation seront facturés conformément
aux termes du Contrat, sans aucune indemnité supplémentaire. Cependant,
le CLIENT reste tenu de régler les sommes restantes dues pour
l'intégralité de la durée du Contrat, y compris pour les équipements et
licences qui étaient facturés sur une base mensuelle.

### 16.2. Résiliation pour manquement

En cas de non-respect par l'une des parties de ses obligations
essentielles stipulées dans le Contrat, la partie affectée enverra à la
partie défaillante une mise en demeure par courrier recommandé avec
accusé de réception, lui accordant un délai de trente (30) jours
ouvrables à compter de la réception de la notification pour corriger la
situation.

Si, passé ce délai, la partie en tort n'a pas rectifié son manquement,
la partie lésée est en droit de procéder à la résiliation du Contrat en
adressant une nouvelle notification par courrier recommandé avec accusé
de réception. Cette résiliation sera effectuée sans qu'aucune
compensation ne soit versée à la partie fautive, tout en se réservant le
droit de réclamer des dommages-intérêts pour les préjudices subis.

La décision de résilier le Contrat pour manquement engage la
responsabilité de la partie initiant cette démarche. Dans le cas où il
serait établi que la partie visée par la résiliation n'a, en fait, pas
failli à ses engagements, la partie ayant engagé la procédure de rupture
se verrait tenue de compenser les dommages encourus par l'autre partie.

### 16.3. Résiliation sans faute

Chaque partie se réserve le droit de résilier le Contrat sans préavis ni
indemnisation dans les circonstances suivantes, en envoyant une lettre
recommandée avec avis de réception :

1.  En cas de dépôt de bilan de l'autre partie, sauf si l'administrateur
    judiciaire opte pour la poursuite du Contrat dans le délai légal.
2.  Si un changement de contrôle survient chez l'autre partie,
    conformément à l'article L. 233-3 du Code de commerce, résultant en
    sa possession directe ou indirecte par un concurrent de la partie
    invoquant la résiliation.
3.  L'inexécution du Contrat par l'autre partie pour une durée
    supérieure à trente (30) jours calendaires en raison d'un cas de
    force majeure.
4.  Un changement de circonstances imprévisibles au moment de la
    signature du Contrat, modifiant significativement son équilibre
    économique.

5. The repeated and abusive use by the CLIENT of the liability clause without basis, placing the Service Provider in a financially detrimental situation or making the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason of Contract termination:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the terms described in the article "Reversibility";

- The Service Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all end CLIENT's data.

- This deletion implies a secure deletion of all media containing these data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement. Upon the conclusion of a Contract, regardless of the reason, the Service Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated with the end CLIENT, including the directory, certificates, and access configuration.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (i.e., assisting the Client in migrating their system to another Service Provider) except for providing the CLIENT with the technical interface and APIs allowing the CLIENT to backup and retrieve their data, including configuration data of platforms via one of the following technical methods chosen by the CLIENT: providing files in one or several documented and exploitable formats outside of the service provided by the Service Provider or through the setup of technical interfaces allowing data access according to a documented and exploitable scheme (API).

The CLIENT, being the only master of their System, must take all necessary actions to facilitate this operation as needed (which involves, especially, setting up rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. If the CLIENT requires an additional service, the Service Provider can offer a consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or support.

This includes, but is not limited to, any information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal information, or any other domain, whether or not it is patentable. Among these information, we notably find plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts of needs, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, client names, or partner names.

These Confidential Information can be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, whatever their form (oral, written), the type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To enhance their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed on communication media.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically made during each exchange, indicating the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect in any way the confidential nature of the information nor the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that: - Is already in the public domain without fault of the receiving Party; - Was known to the receiving Party before communication by the issuer, as evidenced by the records of the receiving Party; - Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restriction; - Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information.

The Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and only used for the execution of the Contract. The Parties undertake to:

- Use the Confidential Information solely within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit the disclosure of Confidential Information to their team members involved in the execution of the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the Contract content;
- Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without prior written consent from the other Party, except for legal or judicial necessity;
- Physically protect the Confidential Information, keeping them in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for their security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in force during the term of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination. At the end of the Contract, the Parties agree to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining a copy, unless instructed otherwise by the issuing Party.

The Service Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Service Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, related to subcontracting, and will be liable to the CLIENT for any breach of the obligations prescribed by said law. Resorting to Subcontractors will not reduce in any way the Service Provider's liability to the CLIENT under the Contract; the Service Provider remains fully responsible for the performance of the subcontracted Services vis-à-vis the CLIENT and, in general, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the contract

The Parties agree that the Contract is concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, none of the Parties can assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control (within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset contribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group provided that it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## 21. Labor law regulation

The Service Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1, and following, L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 and following of the Labor Code, regarding the persons it employs.

Under these conditions and in order to comply with the provisions of Articles L. 8221-1 and L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4 of the Labor Code, the Service Provider provides the CLIENT, only upon request:

- All documents required by Article D. 8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- The sworn statement against illegal work.

The Service Provider also undertakes to apply these commitments to all its subcontractors involved during the contract period. For services delivered on the CLIENT's premises, the Service Provider agrees to ensure its employees comply with all the hygiene and safety regulations in force at the CLIENT's. In particular, the Service Provider and its subcontractors must ensure compliance with the provisions of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, setting special health and safety requirements, applicable to work performed within an establishment by an outside company (Art. R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Parties will keep each other informed of any potential difficulties in this regard and the means to address them. The Contract is exclusive of any notion of personnel provision within the framework of the temporary employment regulation.

The Service Provider's staff remains at all times under the exclusive permanent legal subordination of the Service Provider, who alone has the power of direction and control over its employees. The CLIENT cannot give direct orders to the Service Provider's staff and/or to the staff of any possible subcontractors of the Service Provider.

The Service Provider assumes full responsibility for its staff's affiliation to all social organizations and full responsibility concerning labor law. In this respect, the Service Provider certifies that it has made the required declarations to the social protection organizations and does not engage in undeclared work as defined in Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. Should the Service Provider resort to a subcontractor, it commits to ensuring that the latter strictly adheres to the aforementioned legal stipulations.

In accordance with the legal provisions on the prevention and repression of undeclared work, the Service Provider agrees to provide the CLIENT on the date of the Contract signing and every six (6) months until the end of its execution:

- A sworn statement of the filing with the tax administration, on the date of the certificate, of all mandatory tax declarations and the receipt of the filing of the declaration;
