## 4. Object

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions according to
which the Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the Services
defined, specifying the scope of application, the execution modalities
of the Services, as well as the associated financial modalities. The
CLIENT undertakes this contract in its own name and for its own account.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance
of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (CGVU), which the
CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood and accepted
in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it
is strongly recommended to seek the expertise of an IT and network
specialist before proceeding with the acceptance of these conditions.
This step is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the
technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning the selection
of the characteristics of the work units proposed and the determination
of the resources necessary to meet its specific needs.

## 5. General Provisions

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments on behalf of the other
Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions,
statements, commitments, services, products and the actions of their
personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract is found to be invalid
under the applicable legislation or an irrevocable court decision, this
provision will be considered as not written. This invalidity will not
affect the overall validity of the Contract or the force of the other
provisions.

## 6. Service Orders

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative
for the CLIENT to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. In the context of the
creation and management of this account, the CLIENT undertakes to provide
the Provider with all the necessary data for the proper execution of
the contract. These data include, but are not limited to, the email
address, identity and contact information, as well as relevant banking
details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability and updating
of these information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or managed by a third
party acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and
ensure the Provider that it has the necessary authority and legal
capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind it in accordance with
the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account

Before activating the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the
provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the
accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on its behalf.
This verification may include the request for supporting documents for
the information communicated. The Provider also has the right to refuse
the activation or to proceed with the deactivation of the CLIENT Account
in the case where the information would be deemed incomplete, inaccurate,
or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Once the CLIENT Account is activated by the Provider, the CLIENT gains
the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services
requested, orders can be placed via the dedicated CLIENT Management Interface.
The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management of its CLIENT
Account, including the
securing the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT itself, and constitutes its full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract. The modalities and deadlines for availability of the ordered Services vary depending on the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after the Provider has received the full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to verify that the Service delivery conditions meet its requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement and are interpreted in a coherent manner. However, in case of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence shall be given to the documents in the order in which they are listed. The Contract annexes, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical clarification without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the Contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCS) are concluded for an indefinite duration, unless otherwise specified in the Specific Conditions that may provide for a defined duration.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by respecting the modalities specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete retrieval of its data that was stored within the scope of the relevant Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data Retrieval and Erasure".

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to settle the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- Implementation of services according to the purchase order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional service of Reversibility.

Access to these services, as well as their use, is subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the case where certain optional Services have not been initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them later. The provision of any optional Service by the Provider is conditional upon the prior agreement of the parties following a coordinated assessment.

## 10. Service Usage Conditions

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT is obligated to place orders and use the Services while strictly respecting the applicable usage conditions. The use of the Services must be responsible. In particular, the CLIENT commits to familiarizing itself with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCS) and to respecting all the instructions provided at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, it must inform and obtain acceptance of the current usage conditions from these third parties before their use. The CLIENT thus ensures the Provider of the full compliance of these third parties with these conditions.

### 10.2. Service Selection

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT commits to carefully examining the current usage conditions, as well as analyzing in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and service ranges offered, in order to select Services and characteristics that precisely correspond to its needs and those of the third parties using the Services on its behalf or for its account.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities carried out through the use of the Services. For any information request regarding the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of potential changes, particularly when new Orders are issued.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at its own expense and under its responsibility, an appropriate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical issues and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the scope of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet access providers or any other third-party network operator (including, but not limited to, reliability issues of connections, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for any potential repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. It must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences resulting from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

In no case can the Provider's liability be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT commits to promptly notifying the Provider in case of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means, and to immediately initiating replacement or reset procedures for these means.

### 10.5. Contents

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's contents and refrains from any access to these contents, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or update of the mentioned contents.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backups of the contents stored via the Services. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures for the backup of its contents, to protect itself against any risk of loss or deterioration, regardless of the cause, particularly through the use of appropriate units in the Provider's catalog.

The contents managed must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illegal contents (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of contents advocating crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals due to their gender, religion, orientation, or sexual identity, or disability, or infringing on the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or termination of the Contract at the sole expense of the CLIENT. This without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate judicial proceedings or claim damages for any incurred prejudice.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and resources provided, which may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, affecting the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attacks via the Services, including but not limited to port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the provided resources, except for previously authorized intrusion tests by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. use of illegal or prohibited contents, as described previously in the "Contents" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in case of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the usage conditions established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without prior notice, in case of critical situations or to prevent the illegal or fraudulent use of the Services.
an infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to incur the Provider's liability. The Provider strives, to the extent possible and unless required by law or a breach of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from its obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT is informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In the event of the CLIENT's failure to fulfill its obligations, these suspensions will not prejudice the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or claim compensation. Unless in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of the CLIENT's data. Unless exclusively caused by the Provider's fault, these interruptions will not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Provider reserves the right, at its discretion, to make any changes to the Services, including the addition, modification, or removal of ranges, options, features, as well as improvements to their performance. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of Service updates, which will immediately apply to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following changes to third-party products.

In compliance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers," if an update causes a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example, the removal of a feature or a performance decline — the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, it must send a termination notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within a period of sixty (60) days following the implementation of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Usage Rights

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider — including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property of the Provider or its assignees. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to note that, outside of these elements provided, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) it chooses to use or exploit within the scope of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider commits to not exploiting this content for any purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software, codes, and algorithms made available within the scope of the Services, including for reverse engineering attempts, unless explicit legal authorization allows circumventing this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the Contract terms and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the countries hosting the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if it intends to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 of the Council of May 5, 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes solutions governed by U.S. legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to commercial restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or entities in these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including solvency and potential presence of the CLIENT on sanction lists, such as the list of frozen assets of the General Directorate of Treasury, may be carried out. Following these checks, the Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

According to the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Provider disclaims all liability regarding Third-Party Products provided within the scope of the Services. These products may present technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility or stability issues. The Provider offers no guarantees regarding these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. It is particularly prohibited for the CLIENT to decompile, obtain access to source codes, or reinstall Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their adequacy with its specific needs and objectives, while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The termination of the Services, for any reason (such as the termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, the CLIENT's interruption of the Services, breach of the Contract terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, result in the definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the scope of the Services, including any backups.

### 10.13. Intrusion Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, intrusion tests on the Services provided (hereinafter referred to as "Intrusion Tests"). These tests can only be conducted after the signing of an audit agreement by all parties involved in the Service provision, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Provider, and their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and require prior consent from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The modalities of intrusion tests conducted by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations outlined in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring that the auditor complies with these conditions, acting under the CLIENT's responsibility. Intrusion Tests must in no case:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Provider and/or the Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Provider,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures provided by the Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Intrusion Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, potentially causing temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any party affected by this unavailability. At the end of the Intrusion Tests, an audit report will be prepared and made available to the Provider upon request or if it proves relevant (e.g., in the case of vulnerability discovery).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Provider's written consent. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

### 12.2. Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Provider to the CLIENT serve as a fixed compensation for any damage resulting from the failure to meet these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of claim, complaint, or action in this regard.

### 12.5. Third Parties

In the context of this Contract, the Provider assumes no obligations towards third parties, including Users, and no clause should be interpreted as granting beneficial rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, particularly with Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Provider for any request, complaint, or action by third parties that could challenge the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT also undertakes to inform the Provider, in writing and as soon as possible, of any request, complaint, or action by third parties concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request and all relevant information allowing the Provider to provide the CLIENT with the necessary responses or documents it holds.

## 13. Force Majeure

The performance of an obligation, regardless of its nature, is suspended when its performance is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the performance of the Contract. In the event of a case of force majeure preventing the Provider from performing its Services:

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applicable Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the conditions agreed upon at the time of Contract signing. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing grids for its Services, which may include, depending on the case, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits its needs at the time of placing the order.

The prices mentioned are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (excluding the Provider's income taxes) are added to the billed amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price change within the scope of the article dedicated to price revision conditions.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of the Services includes
also the costs related to the acquisition of licenses and usage rights for the tools, software, and operating systems used by the Provider or, where applicable, made available to the CLIENT within the scope of the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any necessary license or usage right for the exploitation of the contents it uses via the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the measurement units used for calculating these prices are available on the Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT consult these information before confirming its order. Any started unit is due in its entirety, even if it is not fully consumed. Moreover, some Services may incur additional costs for their installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its prices at its discretion. Any price change will immediately apply to Orders placed after this change. For Services already subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a notice period of thirty (30) calendar days via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the possibility, during thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be carried out either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered as having accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the penalty-free termination option is not available in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined in Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such cases, the terms specified in the aforementioned article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of the Services is based on the actual usage and the Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annual, or according to another periodicity) as well as the timing (at the order or after delivery) differ according to the Service concerned. The billing terms are determined in accordance with the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any started period is due on a pro-rata basis for the period. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize itself with these conditions before placing an order. After the payment of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt.

The CLIENT explicitly accepts the receipt of invoices via electronic means, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each received invoice, in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.

### 14.4. Default and Delayed Payment

Unless the CLIENT contests in good faith any part of the invoice, in case of failure or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. default penalties will be immediately due from the day after the due date, calculated based on an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting for more than seven (7) calendar days after the sending of a payment default notification by email, will automatically, without further notice or formalities:

- the immediate enforceability of the entire amounts still due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed payment method,
- the right for the Provider to immediately and without prior notice suspend the entire or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid), refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and proceed to the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

In addition, in case of delayed or default payment, professional clients are required to pay a fixed fee of forty (40) euros for recovery costs, without prejudice to the Provider's right to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of proof, if the recovery costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute relating to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT's Management Interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the invoice date. Beyond this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any future potential dispute over the invoice, obliged to pay the amounts due in accordance with the Contract terms. In the event that a billing error is detected, the Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments on the affected invoices, within the applicable prescription deadlines.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Failure to meet the Service Level Objectives set out in the SecNumCloud Services Agreement entitles the CLIENT to apply penalties. The application of penalties must be requested by the CLIENT by email within a maximum period of ninety (90) days after the triggering event. In the case of a failure not attributable to the Provider, but to the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty will be applicable to the Provider.

The penalties will be calculated based on the non-compliant reference indicator. In any case, the total monthly penalty amount cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned on the invoice for the month. When the CLIENT requests the application of penalties, the payment of these penalties by the Provider will constitute a fixed and final compensation for damages and losses related to the incidents causing the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of Penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the availability promised by the SLA of the Service concerned during the calculation period and the actual availability of the Service concerned during the calculation period.**

***Example: Non-compliance with SLA 1 -- 3 and 4***

- *SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 -- Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%***
- *SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 -- Backup: 99.9%; current month rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%***
- *SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 -- Internet Access 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%***

In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned on the invoice for the month. Furthermore, the penalties always constitute a fixed and final compensation for damages and losses related to the incidents causing the penalties, these penalties having a liberating character.

The penalties will be applied as a credit on the next month's Regular Service amount. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract regardless of the cause, the Provider will pay the remaining amount to the CLIENT by bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination at Will

The CLIENT is allowed to terminate the Contract, without having to justify its decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month has elapsed following the activation of the Contract. To do so, it must notify its termination by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Provider up to the effective date of termination will be billed in accordance with the Contract terms, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay the remaining amounts due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In the event of a failure by one of the parties to fulfill its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send a formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt to the defaulting party, granting it a period of thirty (30) working days from the date of receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the defaulting party has not rectified its breach, the injured party is entitled to terminate the Contract by sending a new notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation being paid to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the losses incurred.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the responsibility of the party initiating this procedure. In the case where it is established that the party subject to termination has, in fact, not failed to fulfill its obligations, the party initiating the termination procedure will be required to compensate the other party for the damages incurred.

### 16.3. Termination Without Fault
Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation under the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of bankruptcy of the other party, unless the judicial administrator chooses to continue the Contract within the legal period.
2. If a change of control occurs in the other party, in accordance with article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect ownership by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. Non-performance of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to a force majeure event.
4. A change in unforeseen circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. Abuse and repeated use by the CLIENT of the liability clause without foundation, placing the Provider in a financially prejudicial situation or making the Contract unprofitable.

- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all the final CLIENT's data.
- This deletion involves the secure deletion of all media containing these data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include a reversibility obligation (i.e., assistance to the Client to migrate its system to another Provider) except for the provision by the Provider to the CLIENT of the technical interface and APIs allowing the CLIENT to back up and recover its data, including notably the configuration data of the platforms via one of the following technical modalities at the CLIENT's choice: the provision of files following one or more documented and usable formats outside the service provided by the Provider, or the implementation of technical interfaces allowing access to the data following a documented and usable schema (API).

The CLIENT, as the sole master of its System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation when needed (which implies, among other things, that it must implement thorough documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. In the event the CLIENT requires additional services, the Provider may propose a consulting mission in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975 relating to subcontracting, and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any failure to comply with the obligations set forth in said law.

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded in good faith.
