## 2. Préambule

These General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (hereinafter referred to by the acronym "CGVU"), together with the annex titled Service Agreement, constitute a contract (hereinafter the "**Contract**") established between Cloud Temple, a Simplified Joint Stock Company governed by French law, with a share capital of 13,425,850 euros, registered with the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under number 825 400 336, whose registered office is located at *Belvédère 1 - 7 cours Valmy Spaces, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as the "**Supplier**"), and any entity, whether a natural or legal person, acting as a consumer or professional, under private or public law, having subscribed to an offer for the provision of Infrastructure-as-a-Service compliant with the SecNumCloud Framework (hereinafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Supplier are respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and "Parties" when mentioned jointly. It is specified that the terms used with a capital letter in this Contract are defined in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, titled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and stakeholders of the Contract, while respecting the conventions and precision required in legal language.

In case of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained in the annexed documents, priority will be given to the hierarchically superior document. The most recent and officially approved version of a document takes precedence over all its previous versions. Thus, in the event of a conflict between one or more provisions within the same document, the subsequently validated version will prevail.

The fact that a stipulation appearing in a lower-ranking document is not expressly mentioned in the higher-ranking document does not detract from its legal value.

## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider commits to providing the defined Services to the CLIENT,
specifying the scope, modalities of performance of the Services, and associated financial terms. The CLIENT commits under this contract on their behalf and for their account.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unconditional acceptance of the General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU),
which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional,
it is highly recommended to seek the expertise of an IT and network specialist before accepting these terms.
This process is essential to ensure an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, notably regarding the selection
of the proposed work unit characteristics and determining the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party commits not to make commitments on behalf of the other Party.
The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions of their personnel.

If a Contract provision is found to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision,
this provision will be considered as unwritten. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the force of other provisions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, the CLIENT must have a valid **CLIENT Account**.
In creating and managing this account, the CLIENT commits to providing the Provider with all necessary data for the
proper execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to, the email address, identity and contact information,
as well as relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability, and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

If the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting on behalf of the CLIENT,
this third party must attest and assure the Provider that they possess the necessary legal authority and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and commit them per the contract's provisions.

### 6.2. CLIENT Account Activation

Before CLIENT Account activation, and at any time during the service provision, the Provider reserves the right to verify
the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include requesting supporting documents
to back up the provided information. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or proceed with the deactivation
of the CLIENT Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Ordering

Upon the Provider's activation of their CLIENT Account, the CLIENT can order Services. Depending on the nature of the requested Services,
orders can be placed via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing their CLIENT Account,
including securing authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order made from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves and represents their full and complete acceptance of the terms of the Contract.
The availability terms and timelines for ordered Services vary depending on the required Service type. Some Services will be available only after
the Provider has received the full CLIENT payment. Thus, it is incumbent upon the CLIENT to verify that the service provision conditions meet their requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract are complementary and interpreted coherently. Nevertheless, in the event of contradiction or discrepancies between them, precedence
will be given to the documents in the order in which they were listed. The Contract's annexes, which detail the Services technically, should not contradict
the principles established in the Contract's main body. Their role is to provide technical precision without undermining the document's general provisions.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU) are concluded for an indefinite period unless otherwise stipulated
in the Special Terms providing for a determined period.

Contract termination is possible only by respecting the terms specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure
the complete retrieval of their data stored under the affected Contract(s), per the article's provisions
related to "Data Retrieval and Deletion."

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the CLIENT from the obligation to pay for Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of Services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the order form,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Agreement, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Agreement, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them at a later date.
The provision of any Optional Service by the Provider is subject to the prior agreement of the parties following a joint assessment.

## 10. Terms of Use for Services

### 10.1. Compliance with Service Conditions

The CLIENT is obliged to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use.
The use of the Services must be carried out responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize themselves with the current General Conditions of Sale and Use (GCSU) and to adhere to all the guidelines provided at the time of order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use by these third parties, to make them aware of and accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Provider of full compliance with these terms by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of Services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT commits to carefully reviewing the current Terms of Use, as well as to thoroughly analyzing all documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, in order to choose Services and features that precisely meet their needs and those of third parties using the Services on their behalf or for their account.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the Services selected comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted via the use of the Services. For any information request related to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed about any changes that may occur, especially when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection
Access to the Services requires the CLIENT to have, at their own expense and under their responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network can experience technical issues and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the framework of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for any consequential impacts of such malfunctions, especially when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords required to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences resulting from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the authentication methods assigned to users.

Under no circumstances shall the responsibility of the Provider be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to promptly notify the Provider in case of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication methods and to immediately initiate procedures for their replacement or reset.

### 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of Services. Thus, the Provider does not check, validate, or update the mentioned content.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backups of content stored via the Services. Therefore, it is the CLIENT's responsibility to take appropriate measures to back up their content to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, notably through the use of appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illegal content (such as the distribution, publication, storage, or transmission of content that glorifies crimes, incites hatred or violence against individuals due to their gender, religion, orientation or sexual identity, or disability, or violates others' intellectual property rights) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the sole discretion of the Provider, in the immediate suspension of the Services, the deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even the termination of the Agreement to the exclusive fault of the CLIENT. This is without prejudice to the right of the Provider to initiate legal proceedings or claim damages for any suffered prejudice.

### 10.6. Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Standards

The Services must be used responsibly, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and provided resources that may compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. attempts at intrusion or attack via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, and any form of attack emanating from the provided resources, except for penetration tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illegal or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or totally suspend Services in the event of:

1. a real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Trust in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Agreement.

This suspension can be immediate, without notice, in case of a critical situation or to prevent illegal or fraudulent use of the Services, infringement of third-party rights, or any act likely to engage the responsibility of the Provider.
The Provider strives, as much as possible and except in cases of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Agreement. The CLIENT is kept informed of planned maintenances via a dedicated interface.

In case of the CLIENT's breach of their obligations, these suspensions are without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Agreement or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of CLIENT data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Agreement.

### 10.8. Evolution of Services

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any changes to the Services, including the addition, modification, or deletion of ranges, options, functionalities, and the improvement of their performances. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following changes to third-party products.

In accordance with the "Specific Conditions for Consumers" article, if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT — for example, the removal of a feature or a performance drop —, the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service. To do so, they must send a notification
of termination by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the application of the change.

### 10.9. Intellectual property and right of use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Service Provider — including software, infrastructure, documentation, and others — remain the exclusive property of the Service Provider or its assignees. The Service Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, aside from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that they choose to use or exploit within the framework of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as their Users, retain ownership of their content. The Service Provider agrees not to use this content for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with current laws, the CLIENT must not decompile the software, codes, and algorithms made available within the framework of the Services, including any attempts at reverse engineering, except where explicit legal authorization allows bypassing this restriction.

### 10.10. Export control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and restrictions related to the CLIENT's specific activities, the Service Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union and in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the responsibility of the CLIENT, if they plan to use the Services or allow their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that this use complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes but is not limited to compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, regarding the control of exports of dual-use items, as well as US regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Service Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by US law.

The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from individuals or legal entities from these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including solvency and the potential presence of the CLIENT on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the General Directorate of the Treasury, can be conducted. Following these checks, the Service Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-party products

In accordance with the commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. the Service Provider declines all responsibility for Third-Party Products provided as part of the Services.
These products may have technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility, or stability issues. The Service Provider offers no warranty regarding these Third-Party Products, including but not limited to any associated information or elements such as software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. the use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. The CLIENT is notably prohibited from decompiling, accessing source codes, or reinstalling Third-Party software or systems on other infrastructures.
Responsibility for the use of Third-Party Products rests entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their adequacy with specific needs and objectives, while respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Continuity and reversibility of services

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as termination of the Contract, its non-renewal, Service interruption by the CLIENT, breach of Contract terms, etc.), as well as certain update or reinstallation operations, lead to the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise used or exploited within the framework of the Services, including possible backups.

### 10.13. Intrusion testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or via a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (referred to here as “Intrusion Tests”). These tests can only be conducted after signing an audit agreement by all parties involved in the provision of the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, and their subcontractors, if applicable.
These tests must comply with current legislation and require the prior agreement of the users and the rights holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Intrusion Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate agreement between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the responsibility of the CLIENT. The Intrusion Tests must in no case:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Service Provider and/or the Service Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Service Provider,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Service Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the consequences arising from the Intrusion Tests, including those resulting from actions conducted by an external auditor. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to perform all necessary backups before the tests to ensure system restoration in the event of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, which may result in temporary unavailability of the Services. The CLIENT must inform any affected party of this unavailability. At the end of the Intrusion Tests, an audit report will be written and made available to the Service Provider upon request or if deemed relevant (for example, in case of vulnerability discoveries).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written authorization of the Service Provider. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge being subject to a collaboration obligation. Consequently, they commit to sharing any information and documents likely to facilitate the execution of the Contract, and more particularly, their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and warrants that they have the necessary authority and capacity to enter into the Contract and perform the obligations incumbent upon them. The CLIENT and the Service Provider declare and warrant that they have all the authorizations, skills, and knowledge (including technical) enabling them to respectively use and provide the Services in accordance with the terms of the Contract.

### 12.2. Liability of the Service Provider

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the penalties or credits granted by the Service Provider to the CLIENT serve as flat-rate compensation for any damage resulting from non-compliance with these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form of claim, demand, or action in this regard. If no service level commitment is applicable, the maximum liability attributable to the Service Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT for the affected services during the three (3) months preceding the compensation request.

**Disclaimer of liability:** The Service Provider's liability cannot be engaged in the following cases:

- Misuse of the services contrary to the terms of the Contract;
- Failure, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Service Provider’s subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or the CLIENT’s negligence;
- Indirect damages such as commercial loss, order loss, business decline, harm to reputation, loss of profits or clients, notably due to accidental disclosure of confidential information, third-party legal action, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the infrastructure, to the extent that the Service Provider is not responsible for the CLIENT's business continuity, including backups;

- Inadequacy of services to the CLIENT's needs (particularly with regard to the sensitivity of the data involved);
- Security incidents related to Internet use, especially in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to the CLIENT's data or information on or from the Internet;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT's Responsibility

The CLIENT is fully responsible for the risks associated with its activities, including the use of the Services provided by the Service Provider and full compliance with the terms of the Contract.
This responsibility extends to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

particularly with the Users of the Services, and undertakes to indemnify the Service Provider for any request, complaint, or action by third parties that could
question the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Service Provider.

allowing the Service Provider to provide the CLIENT with elements of response or useful documents in its possession.

## 13. Force majeure

The execution of an obligation, whatever it may be, is suspended when its execution is prevented by a case of force majeure as defined by article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event of force majeure preventing the Service Provider from performing its Services:

- From the occurrence of the event constituting a case of force majeure, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to jointly study solutions ensuring
the resumption of the Services and agree on the terms of implementing these solutions, which must occur no later

- If the duration exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the case of force majeure, or if the
Parties fail to agree on the replacement solution by the same deadline, the CLIENT may then entrust the Services,
subject of the Contract, to another Service Provider of its choice, thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase to the extent that the nature, severity, and impact of the force majeure allow;
- Conversely, if the Service Provider, within a period less than thirty (30) calendar days from the occurrence of the event constituting
the case of force majeure, manages to resume its obligations normally, the force majeure case having ceased, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, each party may terminate the Contract by sending a registered letter to the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the aforementioned solutions will be borne by the Party affected by the case of force majeure.

## 14. Financial Conditions

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the prices in effect at the time the invoice is issued, in accordance with the terms agreed
upon at the signing of the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Service Provider offers various rate schedules for its
Services, which may include, as the case may be, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering several pricing options,
the CLIENT is free to choose the option that best suits them at the time of placing their order.

The mentioned prices are exclusive of taxes for the Services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (except for
income taxes of the Service Provider) are added to the invoiced amount. This additional taxation does not constitute a price modification in the sense
of the article dedicated to the conditions for revising rates.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of the Services also includes the fees related to acquiring licenses and usage rights
of tools, software, and operating systems used by the Service Provider or, as the case may be, provided to the CLIENT within the Services framework.
It is up to the CLIENT to obtain and pay for any license or usage right necessary for exploiting the content they use through the Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the measurement units used for calculating these prices are available on the Service Provider's website.
The CLIENT is advised to consult this information before confirming their order. Any started measurement unit is due in its entirety,
even if not fully consumed. Additionally, some Services may incur additional costs for installation or commissioning.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Service Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its discretion. Any price modification will apply immediately to Orders placed after
this modification. For Services already subscribed to, any rate increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the option, within thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties.
This termination can be done either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or via a specific form available in the CLIENT's Management Interface.
In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option
of termination without penalties is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by article 1195 of the Civil Code.
In such circumstances, the terms specified in that article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is based on the actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Service Provider's information system, 
which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of disputes with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, yearly, or otherwise) as well as the 
timing (at order or after delivery) vary depending on the concerned Service. The billing methods are determined according to the technical and commercial offer.
approved by the CLIENT and the Provider. Any period begun is due on a pro-rata basis. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these terms before placing an order. 
Upon payment of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt. 

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. 
It is the CLIENT's responsibility to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the legal requirements in effect.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Unless there is a good faith dispute by the CLIENT regarding the invoice, in whole or in part, in the event of default or delay in payment, including partial payment,
the following consequences will apply:

1. late penalties will be immediately due from the day after the due date, calculated based on an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate, 
2. any delay or default in payment (even partial) of amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting for more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a 
notice of default by email, will automatically, without further notice or formality, result in:

- the immediate payment of all amounts remaining due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initially agreed method of payment,
- the right for the Provider to immediately and without prior notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for), 
to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email. 

Additionally, in the event of late or default in payment, professional clients are required to pay a flat fee of forty (40) euros for collection costs,
without prejudice to the right for the Provider to seek additional compensation, upon presentation of supporting documents, if the collection costs incurred exceed this flat fee amount. 

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute regarding billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT's Management Interface,
within a maximum period of one (1) month following the invoice issuance date. After this period, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay the amounts due in accordance 
with the terms of the Contract, despite any future dispute about the invoice. In the event a billing error is found, the Provider reserves 
the right to make the necessary adjustments to the affected invoices, in accordance with applicable prescription periods. 

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

The non-compliance with the Service Levels outlined in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement entitles the CLIENT to apply penalties.
The CLIENT will request the application of penalties by email within a maximum period of 90 (ninety) days after the generating event.
In the case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Provider, but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalty will be applicable to the Provider.

Penalties will be calculated in relation to the non-compliant reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot 
exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned in the invoice of the month. When the CLIENT requests the application of penalties, 
the payment of these penalties by the Provider will constitute a flat-rate and definitive compensation for damages concerning the incidents that led to the penalty.

### 15.2. Calculation of penalties

**Penalties = Percentage difference between the promised availability by the Service SLA for the calculated period and the actual availability of the considered service during the calculation period.**

_**Example: Non-compliance with SLAs 1 – 3 and 4**_

- _SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_
- _SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; current month rate 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%**_
- _SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access 99.9%; current month rate 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%**_

In any case, all penalties under the present General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) 
of the concerned services' amount in the invoice of the month. Furthermore, penalties always constitute a flat-rate and definitive compensation for damages 
regarding the incidents that gave rise to the penalties, as these penalties have a discharge characteristic. 

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit for the amount of the Regular Service in the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract 
for any reason, the Provider will pay the balance to the CLIENT by bank transfer. 

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for Convenience

The CLIENT is permitted to terminate the Contract, without needing to justify their decision or incur penalties, after the lapse of one (1) month following the activation of the Contract.
To do so, they must notify their resolution by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Provider. 

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. Services provided by the Provider until the effective termination 
date will be billed in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional indemnity. However, the CLIENT remains obligated to pay 
the amounts remaining due for the entire duration of the Contract, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis. 

### 16.2. Termination for Default

In the event of non-compliance by one of the parties with their essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party 
a formal notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) business days from receipt of the notification to rectify the situation.

If, after this period, the defaulting party has not corrected their breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to terminate the Contract by sending a new notification 
by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be carried out without any compensation 
to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the suffered losses. 

The decision to terminate the Contract for default engages the responsibility of the party initiating this process. In the case where it is 
found that the party being terminated did not, in fact, fail to meet their commitments, the party who initiated the termination process will be 
required to compensate the losses incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination Without Fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation under the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In the event of bankruptcy filing of the other party, unless the court-appointed administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal timeframe.
2. If there is a change of control at the other party, in accordance with article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or 
indirect ownership by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The non-fulfillment of the Contract by the other party for a period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days due to an event of force majeure.
4. An unforeseeable change in circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The repeated and abusive use by the CLIENT of the liability clause without basis, placing the Provider in a prejudicial financial situation or making the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason of Contract termination:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the terms described in the "Reversibility" article;
- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all the CLIENT's final data.

This deletion involves secure erasure of all media containing these data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement.
After concluding a Contract, regardless of the reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated 
with the CLIENT's final data, including the directory, certificates, and access configurations. 

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include an obligation of reversibility (that is, assisting the Client in migrating their system to another Provider) except for providing the CLIENT with 
the technical interface and APIS allowing the CLIENT to back up and retrieve their data, including notably the configuration data of the platforms 
via one of the following technical modalities at the CLIENT's choice: providing files in one or more documented and usable formats outside 
the service provided by the Provider or by implementing technical interfaces allowing access to the data according to a documented and usable scheme (API).

The CLIENT, being solely responsible for their System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation as needed 
(which implies, in particular, that they set up rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. If the CLIENT needs additional services, the Provider can offer a 

mission of consulting in this regard within the framework of a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract,
is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

- Specific mentions will be affixed to the communication supports.
- A confidentiality reminder will be systematically made during each exchange, with an indication of the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not in any way affect the confidential nature of the information or the Parties' confidentiality obligations.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already public domain without fault of the Receiving Party;
- Was known to the Receiving Party before communication by the Sender, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's records;

At the end of the Contract, the Parties agree to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining any copies, unless otherwise instructed by the Sending Party.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the Contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider must comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, relating to subcontracting,
and will be responsible towards the CLIENT for any breach of obligations set out by the said law.
The use of Subcontractors does not in any way reduce the Provider's responsibility towards the CLIENT under the Contract, with the Provider
remaining fully liable for the performance of Subcontracted Services with respect to the CLIENT and, in general, for the correct execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of the contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae. Therefore, neither Party may assign the Contract,
in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, especially in the event of a change of control
(within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial asset contribution. By derogation from the above,
