## 2. Preamble

These General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (hereinafter referred
to by the acronym "CGVU"), together with the annex entitled Service
Agreement, constitute a contract (hereinafter the "**Contract**") established
between Cloud Temple, a Simplified Joint Stock Company regulated by French law,
with a share capital of 13,425,850 euros, registered in the Trade and Companies
Register of Nanterre under the number 825 400 336, whose head office is located
at *Belvédère 1 - 7 cours Valmy Spaces, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as the
"**Service Provider**"), and any entity, whether a natural or legal person, acting as
a consumer or professional, of private or public law, having subscribed to an
offer of Infrastructure-as-a-Service supply in accordance with the SecNumCloud
Reference Framework (hereinafter referred to as the "**CLIENT**").

For the purposes of this Contract, the CLIENT and the Service Provider are
respectively referred to as "Party" when mentioned separately and as "Parties"
when mentioned jointly. It is specified that the terms used with an initial
capital letter in this Contract are defined according to the provisions of
Article 1, entitled "Definitions".

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and stakeholders of
the Contract, while respecting the conventions and precision required in legal
language.

All services offered by Cloud Temple are available globally for
clients who subscribe to the offers presented on their online platform,
accessible at [the following address](https://www.cloud-temple.com).

In the event of discrepancies between one or more provisions contained
in the annexed documents, priority will be given to the hierarchically higher
document. The most recent and officially approved version of a document prevails
over all its previous versions. Thus, in the event of divergence between one or
more provisions within the same document, it is the subsequently validated version
that will prevail.

The fact that a provision appearing in a lower-ranking document is not expressly
mentioned in the higher-ranking document does not cause it to lose its legal value.

## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which
the Service Provider undertakes to provide the Client with the defined
Services, specifying the scope, execution methods of the Services, and
the associated financial terms. The Client commits to this contract in
their own name and on their behalf.

The Client's adherence to this contract implies unconditional acceptance
of the General Terms of Sale and Use (GTSU), which the Client declares
to have previously consulted, understood, and accepted in full. Although
the Client operates as a professional, it is highly recommended that
they seek the expertise of an IT and network specialist before accepting
these terms. This step is essential to ensure an informed decision
regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly concerning
the selection of the proposed work unit characteristics and the
determination of the resources necessary to meet their specific needs.

## 5. General Provision

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments on behalf of and for the
other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their
actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and the actions
of their personnel.

In the event that any provision of the Contract proves invalid under
applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, this provision will be
deemed unwritten. This invalidity does not affect the overall validity
of the Contract nor the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering Services

### 6.1. CLIENT Account

To access and order the Services offered by the Service Provider, it
is imperative for the Client to have a valid **CLIENT Account**. As
part of creating and managing this account, the Client undertakes to
provide the Service Provider with all the data necessary for the proper
execution of the contract. This data includes, but is not limited to,
the email address, identity and contact information, as well as the
relevant banking details. The Client guarantees the accuracy,
reliability, and update of this information for the entire duration of
the Contract.

If the Client Account is established or managed by a third party acting
on behalf of the Client, this third party must attest and ensure to the
Service Provider that they have the legal authority and capacity to act
on behalf of the Client and bind them in accordance with the provisions
of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT Account

Before activating the Client Account, as well as at any time during the
service provision, the Service Provider reserves the right to verify the
accuracy of the information provided by the Client or on their behalf.
This verification may include requesting supporting documents for the
information provided. The Service Provider also has the right to refuse
activation or proceed with the deactivation of the Client Account if the
information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Once their Client Account is activated by the Service Provider, the
Client acquires the ability to order Services. Depending on the nature
of the requested Services, orders can be made via the Management
Interface dedicated to the Client. The Client assumes full responsibility
for managing their Client Account, including securing the authentication
means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the Client Account is considered to have been made
by the Client themselves and entails their full and complete adherence
to the terms of the Contract. The terms and deadlines for making the
ordered Services available vary depending on the type of Service.
required. Certain Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore the CLIENT's responsibility to verify that the conditions for the provision of Services meet their requirements.

The constituent documents of the Contract are complementary and interpreted coherently. Nevertheless, in case of conflict or discrepancies between them, precedence will be given to the documents according to the order in which they have been listed. The annexes of the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Duration of the contract

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) are concluded for an indefinite period unless otherwise stipulated in the Special Conditions which provide for a fixed term.

The termination of the Contract is only possible by adhering to the terms specified in the "Termination" article. Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the full recovery of their data stored under the affected Contract(s), in accordance with the provisions of the article on "Data Recovery and Deletion."

The termination of the Contract, whether initiated by the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of the services

The scope of services specifically includes:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the order form,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, is subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional services

If some optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them later. The provision of any optional Service by the Provider is subject to the prior agreement of the parties following a joint evaluation.

## 10. Terms of use of the services

### 10.1. Compliance with service conditions

The CLIENT is obligated to place orders and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use. The use of the Services must be conducted responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT agrees to familiarize themselves with the current General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCU) and to comply with all guidelines provided at the time of order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use by these parties, to inform them of and have them accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Provider of the complete compliance of these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### 10.2. Choice of services

Before placing an order and using the Services, the CLIENT agrees to carefully review the current terms of use, and to thoroughly analyze all the documentation, configurations, options, and range of services offered, in order to choose Services and features that precisely match their needs and those of the third parties using the Services on their behalf.

The CLIENT ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities carried out through the use of the Services. For any information request regarding the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed of any changes that may occur, especially when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at their own expense and under their responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical issues and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider within the scope of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, but not limited to, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor the potential repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to a service unavailability or interruption.

### 10.4. Authentication means

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and comply with best security practices to maintain the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or misuse or unauthorized use of the means of authentication assigned to users.

Under no circumstances can the Provider's responsibility be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to promptly notify the Provider in case of loss or suspected disclosure of the authentication means and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Content

In accordance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively manage the CLIENT's content and refrains from accessing this content, except within the strict framework necessary for the provision of the Services. Therefore, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation, or update of the mentioned content.

Similarly, the Provider does not provide dedicated backups of the content stored via the Services. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to take appropriate measures for content backup, to protect against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, particularly through the use of appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in accordance with best practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illegal content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission of content promoting crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals because of their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any violation of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in the immediate suspension of the Services, deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even termination of the Contract at the CLIENT's exclusive fault. This is without prejudice to the Provider's right to take legal action or claim damages for the harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethical rules

The Services must be used responsibly, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abusive or fraudulent use of the Services and provided resources, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attacks via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, and any form of attack originating from the provided resources, except for intrusion tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. Any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. The use of illegal or prohibited content, as previously described in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or totally suspend the Services in case of:

1. A real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, Services, or CLIENT data;
2. The implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. Requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. Alerts received pursuant to Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. Violation of the usage conditions established by the Contract.

This suspension can be immediate, without notice, in case of a critical situation or to prevent illegal or fraudulent use of the Services, violation of third-party rights, or any act that may incur the Provider's liability. The Provider strives, as far as possible and unless legally required or in cases of a violation of the usage conditions, to minimize the impact of any suspension on regular service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance through a dedicated interface.

In case of CLIENT's failure to meet their obligations, these suspensions will
shall not prejudice the Service Provider's right to terminate the Contract or
seek remedies. Except in cases of termination or
non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion
of CLIENT data. Unless they are solely due to a
defect of the Service Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as
service unavailability for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service Evolution

The Service Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any
modifications to the Services, including the addition, modification, or
removal of ranges, options, features, as well as
performance improvements. The detailed description of
the Services is available on the Service Provider's website. It is the
CLIENT's responsibility to stay informed about updates to the
Services, which will apply immediately to all new
orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent needs,
such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or
following changes to third-party products.

In compliance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers",
if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by
the CLIENT --- for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance ---
the CLIENT has the right to terminate the affected Service.
To do this, they must send a termination notice
by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within sixty (60) days following the implementation of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual Property and Usage Rights

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Service Provider --- including
software, infrastructures, documentation, and others --- remain the
exclusive property of the Service Provider or its successors. The
Service Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive usage right over these
elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with
contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It should be noted that, besides these provided elements, the CLIENT is
entirely responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions and rights
for the elements and content (data, software,
applications, systems, websites, etc.) that they choose to use or
operate within the scope of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of
their content. The Service Provider commits to not exploiting these contents
for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with
the applicable laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software,
code, and algorithms made available within the scope of the Services, including for any reverse engineering attempts, unless explicitly legally permitted to bypass this restriction.

### 10.10. Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and
the restrictions related to the CLIENT's activities, the Service Provider
guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within
the European Union as well as in host countries of the data centers
providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if they intend to use the Services or
authorize their use by third parties outside the European borders, to ensure that this use complies with the applicable laws and
regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009
concerning the export control of dual-use goods, as well as
U.S. regulations such as the EAR (Export
Administration Regulations) and ITAR (International Traffic in Arms
Regulations), given that the Service Provider distributes third-party solutions regulated by American legislation.

The Service Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from
countries subject to trade restrictions or sanctions, or from
natural or legal persons from these countries or under sanctions. Checks, including solvency and possible presence of
the CLIENT on sanctions lists, such as the assets freeze list of the
Directorate General of the Treasury, may be conducted.
Following these checks, the Service Provider may unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract after informing the CLIENT.

### 10.11. Third-Party Products

In accordance with commitments made, it is important to note that:

1. The Service Provider declines all responsibility for Third-Party Products
    provided within the scope of the Services. These products may present
    technical defects, security vulnerabilities,
    compatibility or stability issues. The Service Provider offers no
    warranty related to these Third-Party Products, including but not
    limited to, any information or associated element such as
    software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. The use of Third-Party Products by the CLIENT is strictly
    limited to the scope of the provided Services. Notably, the CLIENT is prohibited
    from decompiling, accessing source code, or reinstalling Third-Party
    software or systems on other infrastructures. The responsibility for the
    use of Third-Party Products lies entirely with the CLIENT, who must ensure their
    suitability for their specific needs and goals, while
    respecting the terms of the Contract.

### 10.12. Service Continuity and Reversibility

The cessation of Services, for any reason (such as the termination
of the Contract, its non-renewal, interruption of Services by the
CLIENT, violation of the terms of the Contract, etc.), as well as certain
update or reinstallation operations, entails the
definitive and irreversible deletion of all Content (including
information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted,
collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or in any other way
used or exploited within the scope of the Services, including potential
backups.

### 10.13. Penetration Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct, directly or through a specifically mandated external auditor, penetration tests on the provided Services (hereafter referred to as "Penetration Tests"). These tests can only be performed after signing an audit agreement by all parties involved in providing the Service, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, and their subcontractors if applicable. These tests must comply with current legislation and
require the prior consent of users and right holders in the tested domain.

The terms for conducting these Penetration Tests by an external auditor will be defined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and the auditor, incorporating the obligations outlined in this article. The CLIENT
commits to ensuring compliance with these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the CLIENT's responsibility. The Penetration Tests must not under any circumstances:

- Target other infrastructures or services of the Service Provider and/or the Service Provider not exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt the optimal functioning of the Services, infrastructures, and networks of the Service Provider,
- Affect the services, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Service Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the repercussions following
the Penetration Tests, including those resulting
from actions carried out by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT’s responsibility to make all necessary backups before the tests to ensure system restoration in case of an incident.

It should be noted that spam protection mechanisms, DOS/DDOS, and others will remain active during the tests, potentially leading to temporary service unavailability. The CLIENT must inform any party impacted by this unavailability.
At the end of the Penetration Tests, an audit report will be drafted and made available to the Service Provider upon request or if relevant
(for example, in the event of vulnerability discoveries).

This audit report, its content, and all information obtained or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the Service Provider's written consent. In case of violation of the established conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to the Services, without prejudice to any potential damages.

## 11. Collaboration

The Parties recognize that they are subject to an obligation of collaboration. Consequently, they commit to sharing any information and documents that facilitate the execution of the Contract, especially in regards to their respective obligations.

## 12. Liability

### 12.1. Capacity

Each Party declares and guarantees to have the authority and capacity
necessary to enter into the Contract and to perform their
obligations. The CLIENT and the Service Provider declare and
guarantee, in particular, to possess all authorizations, skills,
and knowledge (notably technical) that allow them to respectively
use and provide the Services in accordance with the conditions
provided in the Contract.

### 12.2. Service Provider's Liability

When the Contract stipulates service level commitments, the
penalties or credits granted by the Service Provider to the CLIENT serve as
lump-sum compensation for any damage resulting from non-compliance with
these commitments. Consequently, the CLIENT waives any other form
of any claim, complaint, or action in this regard. If no service level
commitment applies, the maximum compensation attributable to the
Provider is limited to the total amounts paid by the CLIENT for the
affected services during the three (3) months preceding the
compensation claim.

**Liability Disclaimer:** The Provider's liability shall not be engaged
in the following cases:

- Improper use of the services contrary to the terms of the
    Contract;
- Non-execution, failure, malfunction, or unavailability of the
    services due to a third party (other than the Provider's
    subcontractors), the CLIENT, a third-party product, or the CLIENT's
    negligence;
- Indirect damages such as business loss, loss of orders,
    decrease in activity, reputational damage, loss of profits or
    customers, particularly due to an accidental disclosure of
    confidential information, a third-party legal action, etc.;
- Loss, disclosure, or inappropriate or fraudulent use of user
    access credentials, attributable to the CLIENT or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary or permanent
    interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use", including
    at the request of administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of content hosted on the
    infrastructure, insofar as the Provider is not responsible for the
    business continuity of the CLIENT, including backups;
- Inadequacy of the services to the CLIENT's needs (especially
    regarding the sensitivity of the data concerned);
- Security incidents related to the use of the internet,
    including in case of loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or
    unauthorized access to CLIENT data or information on or from the
    internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements
    installed by the CLIENT on the infrastructure.

### 12.3. CLIENT Responsibility

The CLIENT is entirely responsible for risks associated with their
activities, including the use of Services provided by the Provider and
full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This liability extends
to cases where the Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf
of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is responsible for:

- Ensuring that the chosen Services meet their requirements and
    those of any third party using them on their behalf;
- Managing Content - information, data, files, systems,
    applications, software, websites, etc., reproduced, hosted,
    installed, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or used
    in any other way within the Services. This includes control,
    validation, updating, elimination, backup of Content, and
    implementing measures to prevent its loss or alteration, even when
    such content belongs to third parties or is managed on their behalf;
- Complying with applicable laws, regulations, and any applicable
    code of ethics;
- Complying with PGSSI-S (General Security Policy of Healthcare
    Information Systems) if the service under this contract involves
    health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS
    repository.

When the CLIENT uses the Services for professional purposes or acts on
behalf of third parties, they commit to purchasing civil liability
insurance from a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages that
could be attributed to them. They also commit to maintaining this
insurance, or any other insurance offering equivalent coverage, active
throughout the Contract period.

### 12.4. Warranty

Each Party commits to conducting its activities in strict compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. The CLIENT releases the Provider
from any liability and agrees to protect it against any consequence
arising from:

- The use or operation of illegal Content via the Services;
- Fraudulent or non-compliant use of the Services under prevailing
    regulations;
- Operation of the Services violating the rights of third parties;
- Selection of Services inappropriate to the needs of the CLIENT
    or those of third parties;
- Loss, unauthorized or fraudulent use of User credentials.

The CLIENT also promises to actively participate in managing any claim,
complaint, or legal action involving Content or the terms of the
Contract, including those from administrative or judicial authorities,
and agrees to indemnify the Provider for all resulting damages, including
any potential judgments and justified defense costs.

### 12.5. Third Parties

Under this Contract, the Provider does not assume any obligation to any
third parties, including Users, and no clause shall be interpreted as
conferring beneficiary rights to third parties. The CLIENT assumes full
responsibility for their interactions with third parties, particularly
with Users of the Services, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for any
third-party claim, complaint, or action that could challenge the quality
or compliance of Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT also commits to informing the Provider, in writing and as
soon as possible, of any third-party claim, complaint, or action
concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of
the claim and all pertinent information enabling the Provider to provide
the CLIENT with response elements or useful documents in its possession.

## 13. Force Majeure

The execution of any obligation is suspended when its fulfillment is
prevented by a force majeure event as defined by Article 1218 of the
Civil Code.

Initially, force majeure events will suspend the execution of the
Contract. In case of force majeure preventing the Provider from
executing its Services:

- From the occurrence of the event constituting a force majeure
    event, Cloud Tempe will approach the CLIENT to jointly study
    solutions ensuring the resumption of Services and agree upon the
    implementation modalities of these solutions, which must occur no
    later than forty-eight (48) hours after the event constituting the
    force majeure;
- If its duration exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date
    of the event constituting the force majeure, or if the Parties do
    not reach an agreement on a replacement solution by the expiration
    of this same period, the CLIENT may then entrust the Services,
    subject of the Contract, to another Provider of their choice,
    thereby initiating the Reversibility Phase insofar as the nature,
    severity, and impact of the force majeure permits;
- Conversely, if the Provider manages to normally perform its
    obligations within less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date
    of the event constituting the force majeure, with the force majeure
    ceasing, the Contract will resume its normal execution.

If the force majeure persists beyond thirty (30) calendar days, either
party may terminate the Contract after sending a registered letter to
the other party.

All costs related to the implementation of the above-mentioned solutions
will be borne by the Party affected by the force majeure event.

## 14. Financial Terms

### 14.1. Applied Rates

The rates applied for Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the
prices in effect at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the
conditions agreed upon at the Contract signing. Unless otherwise
specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers
various pricing plans for its Services, which may include, where
applicable, a minimum commitment period and/or a dedicated billing
method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the
CLIENT is free to choose the option that suits them best at the time of
ordering.

The mentioned prices are exclusive of taxes for Services intended for
professionals, meaning that VAT and any other relevant tax (excluding
the Provider's income taxes) are added to the billed amount. This
additional imposition does not constitute a price modification within
the meaning of the article on price revision conditions.

Unless a specific pricing is mentioned, the cost of the Services also
includes fees related to acquiring licenses and usage rights for tools,
software, and operating systems employed by the Provider or, as
applicable, made available to the CLIENT under the Services. It is the
CLIENT's responsibility to obtain and pay for any necessary licenses or
usage rights required for operating the content they use via the
Services.

The pricing structure of the Services and the units of measurement used
for calculating these prices are available on the Provider's website. It
is recommended that the CLIENT consult these details before confirming
their order. Any begun unit of measurement is payable in full, even if
not fully consumed. Additionally, some Services may incur extra costs
for installation or setup.

### 14.2. Price Change

The Provider reserves the right to revise its rates at its
discretion. Any rate change will apply immediately to Orders placed following this change. For Services already subscribed to, any price increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with thirty (30) calendar days' notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT will have the opportunity, during thirty (30) calendar days, to terminate the affected Services without incurring penalties. This termination can be carried out either by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or via a specific form available in the CLIENT Management Interface. In the absence of termination within this period, the CLIENT will be considered to have accepted the new prices. It is important to note that the option of penalty-free termination is not offered in situations where the price increase results from unforeseen circumstances, as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such circumstances, the terms specified in said article will apply.

### 14.3. Billing

The billing of Services is done based on the actual usage and Orders placed by the CLIENT, as recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of a dispute with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annually, or based on another periodicity) as well as the timing (at the order or after delivery) differ depending on the Service concerned. The billing terms are determined according to the technical and commercial offer validated by the CLIENT and the Service Provider. Any period started is due pro rata for the period. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to familiarize themselves with these conditions before placing an order. Upon settling each invoice, the Service Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt.

The CLIENT explicitly agrees to receive invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. It is incumbent upon the CLIENT to save a copy of each invoice received, in accordance with the legal requirements in force.

### 14.4. Default and Late Payment

Unless there is a bona fide dispute by the CLIENT regarding all or part of the invoice, in the event of failure or delay in payment, including partial payment, the following consequences will apply:

1. Late payment penalties will be immediately due from the day after the due date, calculated on the basis of an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate,
2. any delay or default in payment (even partial) of the amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, persisting more than seven (7) calendar days after sending a notification of default payment by email, will automatically, without further notice or formality, lead to:

- the immediate demand for all amounts remaining due by the CLIENT under the Contract, regardless of the initial payment mode agreed,
- the right for the Service Provider to immediately and without notice suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid for), to refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and to proceed with the unilateral termination of the Contract, in whole or in part, by email.

Furthermore, in case of delay or default in payment, professional clients are required to pay a fixed indemnity of forty (40) euros for collection costs, without prejudice to the right for the Service Provider to claim additional compensation, upon presentation of evidence, if the collection costs incurred exceed this fixed amount.

### 14.5. Dispute

Any dispute related to billing or the specifics of the Services must be submitted to the Service Provider's CLIENT Service via the CLIENT Management Interface, within a maximum period of one (1) month following the invoice date. After this period, the CLIENT remains, despite any future potential billing dispute, obligated to settle the amounts due in accordance with the terms of the Contract. In the event of a billing error being identified, the Service Provider reserves the right to make the necessary adjustments to the affected invoices, in accordance with the applicable prescription periods.

## 15. Penalties

### 15.1. Principle

Non-compliance with the Service Levels specified in the SecNumCloud Service Agreement gives the CLIENT the right to apply penalties. The application of penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum of 90 (ninety) days after the triggering event. In case of a breach that is not the responsibility of the Service Provider but of the CLIENT or a Third Party, no penalties will be applicable to the Service Provider.

Penalties will be calculated relative to the unmet reference indicator. In any case, the total amount of monthly penalties cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the Services concerned by the invoice for the month. When the application of penalties is requested by the CLIENT, the payment of these penalties by the Service Provider will constitute a lump-sum and final indemnity for damages concerning the incidents at the origin of the penalty.

### 15.2. Penalty Calculation

**Penalties = Percentage gap between the promised availability by the SLA of the considered Service over the calculation period and the observed availability of the considered service over the calculation period.**

***Example: Non-compliance with SLA 1 – 3 and 4***

- *SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 – Compute Availability: 99.9%; rate for the current month 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%***
- *SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 – Backup: 99.9%; rate for the current month 80%; penalty rate to apply **19.9%***
- *SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 – Internet Access 99.9%; rate for the current month 90%; penalty rate to apply **9.9%***

In any case, all penalties under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use cannot exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of the services concerned by the invoice for the month. Moreover, the penalties always constitute a lump-sum and final indemnity for damages concerning the incidents at the origin of the penalties, with these penalties having a liberating character.

Penalties will be applied in the form of a credit for the Regular Service amount for the following month. If penalties remain due at the end of the Contract for any reason, the Service Provider will pay the remainder to the CLIENT via bank transfer.

## 16. Termination

### 16.1. Termination for Convenience

The CLIENT is allowed to terminate the Contract, without having to justify their decision or incur penalties, once a period of one (1) month has passed following the activation of the Contract. To do so, they must notify their resolution by registered letter with a request for acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the Service Provider.

A notice period of two (2) months is required. The termination takes effect at the end of this period. The services provided by the Service Provider up to the effective date of termination will be invoiced in accordance with the terms of the Contract, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains responsible for paying the remaining amounts due for the entirety of the Contract period, including for equipment and licenses that were billed on a monthly basis.

### 16.2. Termination for Breach

In case of non-compliance by either party with its essential obligations stipulated in the Contract, the affected party will send the defaulting party a formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, granting a period of thirty (30) business days from receipt of the notification to correct the situation.

If, after this period, the party at fault has not remedied its breach, the aggrieved party is entitled to proceed with the termination of the Contract by sending another notification by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt. This termination will be effected without any compensation being paid to the guilty party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the harm suffered.

The decision to terminate the Contract for breach engages the responsibility of the party initiating this step. If it is established that the party targeted by the termination has, in fact, not failed in its commitments, the party initiating the termination process will be required to compensate the damages incurred by the other party.

### 16.3. Termination without Fault

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation in the following circumstances, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In case of bankruptcy filing by the other party, unless the court-appointed administrator opts for the continuation of the Contract within the legal timeframe.
2. If there is a change of control of the other party, as per Article L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code, resulting in its direct or indirect possession by a competitor of the party invoking the termination.
3. The failure to perform the Contract by the other party for more than thirty (30) calendar days due to a case of force majeure.
4. A change in unforeseen circumstances at the time of signing the Contract, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. The CLIENT's repeated and abusive use of the clause of liability without grounds, placing the Service Provider in a detrimental financial situation or making the Contract unprofitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason of the Contract termination:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the reversibility phase according to the
    arrangements described in the "Reversibility" article;

- The Provider is required to ensure the secure deletion of all
    data of the final CLIENT.

- This deletion involves a secure removal of all media that contained this data, in accordance with the provisions of the Service Agreement. Following the conclusion of a Contract, for whatever reason, the Provider is also responsible for eliminating the technical data associated with the final CLIENT, including directories, certificates, and access configurations.

## 17. Reversibility

The Services do not include any reversibility obligation (i.e., assisting the Client to migrate their system to another Provider) except for the provision by the Provider to the CLIENT of the technical interface and APIs that allow the CLIENT to save and retrieve their data, including configuration data of platforms, through one of the following technical methods at the CLIENT's choice: providing files in one or more documented and usable formats outside the service provided by the Provider or by setting up technical interfaces that allow data access according to a documented and usable scheme (API).

The CLIENT, alone master of their System, must do everything possible to facilitate this operation as needed (which implies, among other things, that they set up rigorous documentation for this purpose) and the development of Reversibility plans. If the CLIENT needs an additional service, the Provider can offer consulting services in this regard under a specific contract to be negotiated.

## 18. Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, is considered Confidential Information, regardless of its form or medium.

This includes, but is not limited to, all information related to the Contract, as well as personal, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or other related data, whether or not they are patentable. Among this information are plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, reports, forecasts, software or applications, as well as information concerning prospects, client names, or partners.

These Confidential Information may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of their form (oral, written), type of documents (paper or digital), and by any means of communication. To strengthen their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be placed on communication media.
- A confidentiality reminder will be systematically made during each exchange, indicating the date and reference to this confidentiality commitment.

However, the absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect the confidential nature of the information or the confidentiality obligations of the Parties.

The confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that: - Is already public without fault of the receiving Party; - Was known to the receiving Party before communication by the issuer, as evidenced by the receiving Party's archives; - Is legitimately received from a third party without confidentiality restriction; - Is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to Confidential Information.

Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used only for the execution of the Contract. The Parties commit to:

- Use Confidential Information exclusively within the framework of the Contract;
- Limit disclosure of Confidential Information to team members involved in executing the Contract, ensuring their commitment to maintain confidentiality;
- Preserve the confidentiality of the Contract's content;
- Not disclose Confidential Information to third parties without prior written consent from the other Party unless legally or judicially required;
- Physically protect Confidential Information by storing them in secure locations and taking all necessary measures for their security.

These confidentiality commitments remain in effect for the duration of the Contract and for five (5) years after its conclusion or termination. At the end of the Contract, the Parties undertake to return or destroy all Confidential Information without keeping a copy, except as otherwise instructed by the issuing Party.

The Provider ensures that these confidentiality principles are respected by all its subcontractors during the contract.

## 19. Subcontracting

The Provider shall comply with the mandatory provisions of Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975, regarding subcontracting and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any failure to comply with the obligations set forth by said law. The use of subcontractors will in no way reduce the Provider's responsibility to the CLIENT for the Contract, as the Provider remains fully bound to deliver the subcontracted Services to the CLIENT and, in general, to ensure the proper execution of the Contract.

## 20. Assignment of Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract has been concluded intuitu personae. Consequently, neither Party may assign the Contract, in whole or in part, to a third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, particularly in the event of a change of control (within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the Commercial Code) or partial transfer of assets. Notwithstanding the preceding, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group provided that it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the cession or transfer operation.

## 21. Labor Law Regulations

The Provider declares that it complies with the provisions of Articles L. 8211-1, L. 8221-1 and following, L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4, as well as the provisions of Articles L. 8251-1 and following of the Labor Code, regarding the people it employs.

Under these conditions and to comply with the provisions of Articles L. 8221-1 and L. 8524-1 to L. 8254-4 of the Labor Code, the Provider will provide the CLIENT, only upon request:

- All documents required by Article D. 8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- An affidavit of the fight against hidden work.

The Provider also undertakes to apply these obligations to all its subcontractors involved during the contract term. For the services delivered on the CLIENT's premises, the Provider commits to ensuring that its employees comply with all hygiene and safety regulations in force at the CLIENT's site. Specifically, the Provider and its subcontractors must comply with the stipulations of Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, setting special hygiene and safety requirements for work carried out in an establishment by an external company (Article R. 4511-1 to R. 4515-11 of the Labor Code).

The Parties will keep each other informed of any possible difficulties in this regard and the means to remedy them. The Contract excludes any notion of staff provision within the framework of temporary work regulations.

The Provider's personnel remains under the exclusive legal subordination of the Provider at all times, who alone has the power to direct and control its employees. The CLIENT cannot give orders directly to the Provider's staff and/or the staff of any of the Provider's potential subcontractors.

The Provider is responsible for the affiliation of its staff with all social organizations and bears full responsibility regarding labor law. In this regard, the Provider certifies that it has made the required declarations to social protection organizations and does not engage in hidden work as defined in Articles L. 8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. If the Provider uses a subcontractor, it undertakes to ensure that the subcontractor strictly complies with the legal stipulations listed above.

In accordance with legal provisions on the prevention and punishment of hidden work, the Provider commits to providing the CLIENT at the contract signing date and every six (6) months until its completion:

- An affidavit of deposit with the tax administration, on the date of the certificate, of all mandatory tax returns and the receipt of declaration deposit;
- A certificate of social declarations from the social protection organization responsible for collecting the Provider's social contributions and contributions, dated less than six (6) months old;
- An excerpt of registration in the trade and companies register (K or K-bis for the Provider) or a document compliant with Article D. 8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- An affidavit from the Provider that the work is performed by regularly employed employees regarding Articles L. 1221-10, L. 3243-2, and R. 3243-1 of the Labor Code.

## 22. Ethics and Social Responsibility

Within the framework of the execution of this Contract, the Parties agree that

de scrupulously adhere to the following ethical and legal principles:

- Absolute prohibition on the employment of minor workers, forced labor,
    or any form of compulsory labor, in alignment with the directives of
    the International Labour Organization (ILO);
- Elimination of all discrimination, whether based on sex, race,
    color, social origin, religion, political opinions, membership in
    a national minority, or any other condition, in accordance with the
    applicable legal provisions;
- Combating corruption in all its forms, ensuring total
    integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider is firmly committed to honoring and promoting the
