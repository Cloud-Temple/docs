## 4. Purpose

This Contract aims to establish the terms and conditions according to which the Provider undertakes to provide the CLIENT with the defined Services, specifying the scope, the execution modalities of the Services, as well as the associated financial modalities. The CLIENT engages in this contract in their own name and on their own behalf.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unreserved acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU), which the CLIENT declares to have previously consulted, understood and accepted in their entirety. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is strongly recommended that they seek the expertise of a specialist in computer science and networks before proceeding with the acceptance of these conditions. This approach is essential to guarantee an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the Contract, particularly with regard to the selection of the characteristics of the work units proposed and the determination of the resources necessary to satisfy their specific needs.

## 5. General provision

Each Party undertakes not to make commitments in the name and on behalf of the other Party. The Parties remain individually responsible for their actions, declarations, commitments, services, products and the actions of their personnel.

In the event that a provision of the Contract proves to be invalid under applicable law or an irrevocable court decision, this provision will be considered as not written. This invalidity will not affect the overall validity of the Contract nor the force of the other provisions.

## 6. Ordering services

### 6.1. CLIENT account

To access and order the Services offered by the Provider, it is imperative for the CLIENT to possess a valid **CLIENT Account**. In the context of the creation and management of this account, the CLIENT undertakes to provide the Provider with all the data necessary for the proper execution of the contract. This data includes, without limitation, the email address, identity and contact information, as well as the relevant banking details. The CLIENT guarantees the accuracy, reliability and updating of this information for the entire duration of the Contract.

In the event that the CLIENT Account is established or administered by a third party acting in representation of the CLIENT, this third party must attest and ensure to the Provider that they hold the legal authority and capacity necessary to act on behalf of the CLIENT and commit them in accordance with the provisions of a contract.

### 6.2. Activation of the CLIENT account

Before activating the CLIENT Account, as well as at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may include the request for supporting documents to support the information communicated. The Provider also holds the right to refuse activation or to proceed with the deactivation of the CLIENT Account in the event that the information would be deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### 6.3. Order

Upon activation of their CLIENT Account by the Provider, the CLIENT acquires the possibility to order Services. Depending on the nature of the Services requested, orders can be made via the Management Interface dedicated to the CLIENT. The latter assumes full responsibility for the management of their CLIENT Account, including the security of the authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) associated with it.

Any order placed from the CLIENT Account is considered to have been made by the CLIENT themselves, and entails their full and complete adherence to the terms of the Contract. The modalities and deadlines for making the ordered Services available vary according to the type of Service required. Some Services will only be available after the Provider has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to verify that the conditions for providing the Services meet their requirements.

The documents constituting the Contract complement each other and are interpreted in a coherent manner. Nevertheless, in case of contradiction or divergence between them, precedence will be given to the documents in the order in which they were enumerated. The annexes to the Contract, which technically detail the Services, cannot contradict the principles established in the main body of the Contract. Their role is to provide technical precision without calling into question the general provisions of the document.

## 7. Contract duration

Contracts established under these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise stipulated in the Specific Conditions which would provide for a fixed term.

Termination of the Contract is only possible by respecting the modalities specified in the article "Termination". Before any termination, the CLIENT must ensure the complete recovery of their data that was stored in the context of the Contract(s) concerned, in accordance with the provisions of the article relating to "Data recovery and deletion".

The cessation of the Contract, whether the initiative comes from the Provider or the CLIENT, does not exempt the latter from the obligation to pay the costs related to the Services already provided.

## 8. Scope of services

The scope of services specifically encompasses:

- The implementation of services in accordance with the purchase order,
- The provision of infrastructure services,
- The additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services, as well as their use, are subject to the terms and conditions established in this Contract, including all its associated annexes.

## 9. Optional services

In the event that certain optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the possibility to subscribe to them later. The provision of any optional Service by the Provider is conditional on the prior agreement of the parties following a concerted evaluation.

## 10. Service usage conditions

### 10.1. Compliance with service conditions

The CLIENT undertakes to order and use the Services in strict compliance with the applicable terms of use. The use of the Services must be done in a responsible manner. In particular, the CLIENT undertakes to familiarize themselves with the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (GTCSU) in force and to respect all the guidelines provided to them at the time of the order.

When the CLIENT uses the Services on behalf of third parties or allows third parties to access the Services, they are required, before any use by the latter, to make them aware of and accept the current terms of use. The CLIENT thus assures the Provider of the full compliance with these conditions by the third parties concerned.

### 10.2. Choice of services

Before proceeding with the order and use of the Services, the CLIENT undertakes to carefully examine the current Terms of Use, as well as to analyze in detail all the documentation, configurations, options, and ranges of services offered, this in order to choose Services and characteristics that precisely correspond to their needs and those of third parties using the Services in their name or on their behalf.

The CLIENT particularly ensures that the selected Services comply with the legal and regulatory obligations inherent to the activities conducted via the use of the Services. For any request for information relating to the Services, the CLIENT is invited to contact the Provider. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of the modifications likely to occur, particularly when issuing new Orders.

### 10.3. Connection

Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at their own expense and under their responsibility, an adequate remote connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network). The CLIENT is informed that the Internet network may experience technical hazards and present security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider in the context of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for malfunctions attributable to Internet access providers or any other third-party network operator (including, without limitation, connection reliability issues, bandwidth variations, service interruptions, etc.), nor for the possible repercussions of these malfunctions, particularly when they lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### 10.4. Authentication methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for the management and maintenance of the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and use the Services. They must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and respect the best practices in terms of security to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication means. The CLIENT is solely responsible for the consequences arising from the loss, disclosure or improper or unauthorized use of the authentication means assigned to users.

Under no circumstances can the Provider's liability be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT undertakes to notify the Provider without delay in case of loss or suspected disclosure of authentication means, and to immediately initiate the procedures for replacing or resetting these means.

### 10.5. Content

In compliance with the provisions provided by the Provider, the latter does not actively participate in the management of the CLIENT's content and refrains from any access to this content, except in the strict context necessary for the provision of the Services. Thus, the Provider does not perform any verification, validation or update of the content mentioned.

Similarly, it does not provide dedicated backup of content stored via the Services. It is therefore incumbent upon the CLIENT to take adequate measures for the backup of their content, in order to protect themselves against any risk of loss or deterioration, whatever the reason, notably via the use of appropriate work units in the Provider's catalog.

The managed content must be legal and used in compliance with good practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illicit content (such as the dissemination, publication, storage or transmission of content advocating crimes, inciting hatred or violence against individuals because of their gender, religion, sexual orientation or identity, or disability, or violating the intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any breach of these rules may result, at the discretion of the Provider, in the immediate suspension of the Services, the deactivation of the CLIENT's account, or even the termination of the Contract to the exclusive detriment of the CLIENT. This without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or to claim damages for harm suffered.

### 10.6. Compliance with laws, regulations and ethical rules

The Services must be used in a responsible manner, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Parties agree to remain attentive to legislative and regulatory changes. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this enumeration is not exhaustive:

1. abusive or fraudulent uses of the Services and resources provided, likely to compromise the stability and security of the Provider's systems, potentially affecting the quality of the Services offered to other users;
2. intrusion or attack attempts via the Services including, but not limited to, port scanning, clandestine listening, spoofing, as well as any form of attack emanating from the resources provided, with the exception of penetration tests previously authorized by the Provider;
3. any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. the use of illicit or prohibited content, as described previously in the "Content" section.

### 10.7. Service suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or totally suspend the Services in case of:

1. real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, the Services, or the CLIENT's data;
2. implementation of planned maintenance operations;
3. requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN);
5. violation of the terms of use established by the Contract.

This suspension may be immediate, without notice, in case of a critical situation or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of the Services, an infringement of the rights of third parties, or any act likely to engage the Provider's liability. The Provider strives, to the extent possible and except in case of legal necessity or violation of the terms of use, to minimize the impact of any suspension on the usual service. However, such suspensions do not exempt the CLIENT from their obligation to pay the amounts due under the Contract. The CLIENT remains informed of planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of breach by the CLIENT of their obligations, these suspensions will be without prejudice to the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or to seek compensation. Except in cases of termination or non-renewal, suspensions will not result in the deletion of the CLIENT's data. Unless they are exclusively due to a fault of the Provider, these interruptions will not be considered as an unavailability of the Services for the purposes of the service level commitments stipulated in the Contract.

### 10.8. Service evolution

The Provider reserves the right to make, at its discretion, any modification to the Services, including the addition, modification or removal of ranges, options, features, as well as the improvement of their performance. The detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the responsibility of the CLIENT to stay informed of the updates to the Services, which will apply immediately to all new orders. Changes may also occur immediately in response to urgent necessities, such as security risks or legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or following modifications to third-party products.

In compliance with the article "Specific Conditions for Consumers", if an update results in a degradation of a Service used by the CLIENT --- for example, the removal of a feature or a decrease in performance --- the CLIENT has the right to terminate the Service concerned. To do so, they must send a termination notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, within a period of sixty (60) days following the application of the modification.

### 10.9. Intellectual property and right of use

All elements provided to the CLIENT by the Provider --- including software, infrastructures, documentation, and others --- remain the exclusive property of the Provider or its rights holders. The Provider grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive right to use these elements, strictly for the use of the Services and in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is important to emphasize that, apart from these provided elements, the CLIENT is entirely responsible for obtaining all the authorizations and rights necessary for the elements and content (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) that they choose to use or exploit in the context of the Services.

The CLIENT, as well as their Users, remain the owners of their content. The Provider undertakes not to exploit this content for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is required not to decompile the software, codes and algorithms made available in the context of the Services, including for reverse engineering attempts, except for explicit legal authorization allowing to bypass this restriction.

### 10.10. Export control

Subject to the limitations specified in the terms of the Contract and the restrictions related to the CLIENT's own activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are marketable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is incumbent upon the CLIENT, if they plan to use the Services or authorize their use by third parties outside European borders, to ensure that this use respects the applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of May 5, 2009, concerning the control of exports of dual-use goods, as well as American regulations such as the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and the 'ITAR' (International Traffic In Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by American legislation.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order from countries subject to commercial restrictions or sanctions, or from natural or legal persons from these countries or under sanctions. Verifications, including the solvency and possible presence of the CLIENT on sanctions lists, such as the asset freeze list of the Treasury Directorate General, may be carried out. Following these verifications, the Provider may terminate the contract unilaterally and immediately after informing the CLIENT.
