## Preface

The present General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Use (hereinafter referred to as "CGVU") along with the attached Annex titled Services Agreement, constitute a contract (hereinafter referred to as the “Contract”) established between Cloud Temple, a French Société à Responsabilité Limitée (SARL) registered under French law, with a capital of 13,425,850 euros, and registered at the Commercial and Professional Register of Nanterre under number 825 400 336, whose head office is located at *Belvédère 1 -- 7 cours Valmy Spaces, 92800 Puteaux, France* (hereinafter referred to as the “Provider”), and any entity, whether a natural person or legal person, acting in a consumer or professional capacity, of private law or public law, subscribing to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering compliant with the SecNumCloud Reference Model (hereinafter referred to as the “Client”).

For the purposes of this Contract, the Client and Provider are respectively designated as "Party" when mentioned separately and as "Parties" when mentioned jointly. It is specified that terms used in uppercase within the scope of this Contract are defined according to the provisions of Article 1, titled “Definitions.”

This reformulation aims to clarify and formalize the scope and parties involved in the Contract while adhering to legal precision requirements in language.

**PRIOR NOTICE**

Cloud Temple operates as a specialist in Cloud Computing, providing services including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and professional services.

All services offered by Cloud Temple are globally accessible to clients who subscribe to the offers presented on their online platform, available at [this address](https://www.cloud-temple.com).

In case of discrepancies between provisions in different documents, precedence is given to the hierarchically superior document. The most recent and officially approved version of a document supersedes all prior versions. In cases where there are conflicting stipulations within the same document, the latest validated version takes precedence.

The absence of a provision in a lower-ranked document from being explicitly mentioned in a higher-ranked one does not diminish its legal validity.

## Definitions

## Subject

This contract aims to establish the terms and conditions under which the Provider agrees to deliver the SERVICES defined, specifying the scope of application, execution modalities of services, and financial aspects associated with it. The CLIENT accepts these terms on its own behalf and for its account.

The CLIENT's adherence to this contract implies an unreserved acceptance of the General Terms of Sale and Use (CGVU), which the CLIENT has previously reviewed, understood, and accepted in full. Although the CLIENT operates as a professional, it is strongly recommended that they consult with a specialist in IT and networking before accepting these conditions. This step is crucial for making an informed decision regarding the technical aspects of the contract, particularly concerning the selection of features of the provided units and determining necessary resources to meet specific needs.

## General Provisions

Each Party agrees not to make any commitments on behalf of or for the other Party. Each Party remains individually responsible for its actions, statements, commitments, services, products, and actions of its personnel.

In case a provision of this Agreement is found invalid under applicable law or by an irrevocable judicial decision, such provision will be deemed non-existent. This invalidity shall not affect the overall validity of the Agreement or the enforceability of other provisions.

### Service Request

This section outlines the process for requesting cloud services. It includes details on how to initiate a service request, categorize the request, and track its progress through various stages of approval and provisioning. The system is designed to ensure efficient handling, transparency, and accountability in managing cloud resources.

### CLIENT ACCOUNT

To access and order the Services provided by the Prestataire, it is
essential for the CLIENT to possess a **CLIENT ACCOUNT** that is valid.
In the process of creating and managing this account, the CLIENT
commits to providing the Prestataire with all necessary information
to execute the contract. This includes, but is not limited to, email
address, identity and contact details, as well as relevant banking
information. The CLIENT ensures the accuracy, reliability, and
up-to-date status of these details throughout the Contract's duration.

Should the CLIENT ACCOUNT be established or managed by a third party
acting on behalf of the CLIENT, this third party must confirm and
guarantee to the Prestataire that they hold the requisite legal authority
and capacity to act on behalf of the CLIENT and bind them in accordance
with contractual obligations.

### Client Account Activation

Prior to and at any time during the provision of services, the Provider reserves the right to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the CLIENT or on their behalf. This verification may involve requesting supporting documents for the communicated information. The Provider also has the right to refuse account activation or deactivate the Client Account if the information is deemed incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent.

### Translation

Upon activation of the CLIENT's ACCOUNT by the PRESTAVER, the CLIENT acquires the ability to place orders for SERVICES. The type of SERVICES requested determines how orders are placed via the CLIENT'S dedicated MANAGEMENT interface. The CLIENT is fully responsible for managing their ACCOUNT, including securing authentication means (identifiers, passwords, etc.) linked to it.

Any order placed through the CLIENT'S ACCOUNT is considered as having been made by the CLIENT directly and carries full adherence to the CONTRACT's terms. Delivery times and conditions for the SERVICES ordered vary based on the service type required. Some SERVICES may only become available once the PRESTAVER has received full payment from the CLIENT. It is thus the CLIENT'S responsibility to ensure that the SERVICE delivery conditions meet their requirements.

The CONTRACT's constitutive documents complement and interpret each other consistently. In case of contradiction or divergence, precedence will be given to documents listed in the order they appear, according to the specified hierarchy. The ANNEXES of the CONTRACT, detailing the SERVICES' technical aspects, do not contradict the general principles outlined in the main body of the CONTRACT. Their role is to provide technical precision without challenging the overarching provisions stated in the document.

## Contract Duration

Contracts established under these General Sales and Usage Conditions (CGVU) are concluded for an indefinite period, unless otherwise specified in the Particular Conditions which may stipulate a fixed duration.

Contract termination is solely possible according to the provisions outlined in the "Termination" article. Prior to any termination, the CLIENT must ensure complete recovery of all data stored under the concerned contracts, as per the provisions related to "Data Recovery and Erase".

The cessation of a contract, whether initiated by the Service Provider or the CLIENT, does not relieve the latter from paying for costs associated with previously provided services.

## Scope of Services

The scope of services encompasses:

- Implementation of services in accordance with the order,
- Provision of infrastructure services,
- Additional provision of Reversibility services.

Access to these services and their utilization are subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this Contract, including all associated annexes.

## Optional Services

In the event that certain Optional Services were not initially included in the Contract, the CLIENT has the option to subscribe to them subsequently. The provision of any Optional Service by the Prestator is contingent upon prior agreement between parties following a joint evaluation.

### Compliance with Service Terms

The CLIENT agrees to place orders and utilize the SERVICES in strict adherence to the applicable Service Usage Conditions. The use of the SERVICES must be conducted responsibly. In particular, the CLIENT commits to familiarizing itself with the General Sales and Usage Terms (CGVU) in effect and to complying with all directives provided at the time of ordering.

When the CLIENT uses the SERVICES on behalf of third parties or allows third parties access to the SERVICES, it is obligated, prior to any such use by these parties, to inform and obtain their acceptance of the current usage conditions. The CLIENT ensures that the Service Provider respects the full extent of these conditions by the concerned third parties.

### Service Selection

Prior to placing an order and utilizing the Services, the
CUSTOMER agrees to thoroughly review the current Terms of Service
and analyze all documentation, configurations, options, and service
ranges provided, with the intention of selecting Services and features
that precisely align with their needs as well as those of any third
parties using the Services on their behalf or in their name.

The CUSTOMER pays particular attention to ensuring that the selected
Services comply with all legal and regulatory obligations inherent to
activities conducted through the use of these Services. For any
inquiries regarding the Services, the CUSTOMER is encouraged to contact
the Service Provider. It is the CUSTOMER's responsibility to stay
informed about potential changes, especially when new Orders are issued.

### Connection

Access to the Services requires that the CLIENT has, at their own expense and responsibility, a remote access connection (such as an Internet connection or a private network) in place. The CLIENT is advised that the Internet can experience technical glitches and security risks that are beyond the technical measures deployed by the Provider in the context of the Services.

The Provider cannot be held responsible for any malfunctions attributable to Internet service providers or any other third-party network operators (including, without limitation, issues with connection reliability, bandwidth variations, service outages, etc.), nor can the Provider be held liable for any resulting consequences, especially when these lead to unavailability or interruption of the Services.

### Authentication Methods

The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for managing and maintaining the confidentiality of the identifiers and passwords necessary to access and utilize the Services. It must ensure that authorized users are fully informed and adhere to best security practices to preserve the confidentiality of their authentication methods. The CLIENT is solely responsible for any consequences arising from the loss, disclosure, or abuse/unauthorized use of such authentication methods assigned to users.

In no event shall the PRESTAVER's liability be engaged for such incidents. The CLIENT agrees to promptly notify the PRESTAVER of any suspected loss or disclosure of authentication methods and immediately initiate replacement or re-authentication procedures.

### Content

In accordance with the provisions outlined by the Provider, the latter
does not actively manage the Client's content and refrains from any
access to these contents, except within the strictly necessary scope for
providing the Services. Consequently, the Provider does not conduct any
content verification, validation, or updates of the mentioned contents.

Similarly, it does not ensure a dedicated backup for contents stored via
the Services' platform. It is therefore the Client's responsibility to
take appropriate measures for backing up their content, in order to
protect against any risk of loss or degradation, regardless of the cause,
especially by utilizing the appropriate units of work available in the
Provider's catalog.

The managed contents must be legal and used in compliance with good
practices, as well as applicable laws and regulations. The use of illegal
contents (such as dissemination, publication, storage, or transmission
of content inciting crimes, promoting hatred or violence against individuals
based on their sex, religion, orientation, or gender identity, or handicap,
or infringing intellectual property rights of others) is strictly prohibited.

Any violation of these rules may result, at the Provider's discretion, in
an immediate suspension of Services, deactivation of the Client's account,
or termination of the Contract solely at the Client's expense. This is
without prejudice to the Provider's right to initiate legal proceedings or
claim damages for any incurred harm.

### Compliance with Laws, Regulations, and Ethical Standards

The Services must be utilized responsibly, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Parties agree to remain vigilant regarding changes in legislation and regulation. The following practices are expressly prohibited, although this list is not exhaustive:

1. Abuse or fraudulent use of Services and provided resources, potentially jeopardizing the stability and security of Provider's systems, impacting the quality of Services offered to other users;
2. Attempts at intrusion or attack via Services, including but not limited to port scanning, eavesdropping, spoofing, and any form of attack originating from provided resources (excluding pre-authorized penetration testing authorized by the Provider);
3. Any form of SPAM or similar "spamming" practices;
4. Use of illicit or prohibited content, as previously detailed in the "Content" section.

### Service Suspension

The Provider reserves the right to temporarily or completely suspend the Services in the following circumstances:

1. A real threat to the security or stability of the Provider's systems, the Services, or Client data;
2. Implementation of scheduled maintenance operations;
3. Requests from judicial or administrative authorities;
4. Alerts received in accordance with Article 6 of the Digital Economy Trust Act (LCEN);
5. Violation of usage conditions outlined in the Contract.

Such suspension can be immediate, without prior notice, in critical situations or to prevent illicit or fraudulent use of Services, infringement of third-party rights, or any act potentially implicating Provider liability. The Provider strives to minimize the impact of such suspensions on regular service provision, within the bounds of legal necessity and adherence to usage conditions. However, these suspensions do not exempt the Client from fulfilling outstanding payment obligations under the Contract. Clients are informed about planned maintenance via a dedicated interface.

In case of Client non-compliance with their obligations, these suspensions will not preclude the Provider's right to terminate the Contract or seek compensation. Suspensions, except in cases of termination or non-renewal, do not result in data deletion from the Client’s end. Unless solely due to Provider failure, such interruptions are not considered a complete unavailability of Services for the purpose of service level agreement (SLA) commitments outlined in the Contract.

### Evolution of Services

The Provider reserves the right to make any modifications to the Services at its discretion, including adding, modifying, or removing service lines, options, features, and enhancing their performance. A detailed description of the Services is available on the Provider's website. It is the Client's responsibility to stay informed about Service updates, which will apply immediately to all future orders. Changes can also occur immediately due to urgent matters such as security risks, legal or regulatory compliance requirements, or as a result of changes to third-party products.

In accordance with the "Consumer Specific Conditions," if a service update results in degradation of a Service used by the Client (e.g., removal of a feature or performance drop), the Client has the right to terminate the affected service. To exercise this right, the Client must send a termination notice via registered mail with request for receipt, within 60 days following the application of the modification.

### Intellectual Property and Usage Rights

All elements provided by the Prestataire to the CLIENT, including software, infrastructure, documentation, and others, remain the exclusive property of the Prestataire or its right holders. The Prestataire grants the CLIENT a non-exclusive usage right to these elements solely for the purpose of utilizing the Services, in accordance with the contractual terms, for the duration of the agreement. It is crucial to highlight that, outside of these provided elements, the CLIENT bears full responsibility for obtaining all necessary authorizations and rights for any additional elements (data, software, applications, systems, websites, etc.) it chooses to use or exploit within the Services' framework.

The CLIENT, as well as its Users, remain the owners of their content. The Prestataire commits to not exploiting these contents for purposes other than those stipulated in the contract. In accordance with applicable laws, the CLIENT is obligated not to decompile any software, codes, or algorithms made available under the Services' umbrella, including for reverse engineering purposes, unless explicit legal authorization permits circumventing this restriction.

### Export Control

Subject to the limitations specified in the Contract terms and any restrictions related to CLIENT's own activities, the Provider guarantees that the Services are commercially viable and usable within the European Union as well as in the host countries of the Data Centers providing the Services.

It is the CLIENT's responsibility, if considering using the Services or allowing their use by third parties outside Europe, to ensure such usage complies with applicable laws and regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, compliance with Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of the Council of 5 May 2009 on export controls for dual-use items, as well as U.S. regulations such as EAR (Export Administration Regulations) and 'ITAR' (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), given that the Provider distributes third-party solutions governed by U.S. law.

The Provider reserves the right to refuse any order originating from countries subject to commercial restrictions or sanctions, or individuals or entities within those countries or under sanctions. Due diligence, including solvency checks and potential listing on sanctions lists (e.g., the EU Asset Freezing Regulations), may be conducted. Upon completion of these checks, the Provider can unilaterally and immediately terminate the contract, notifying the CLIENT in advance.

### Third-Party Products

In accordance with our commitments, it is important to note that:

1. The Provider disclaims all responsibility for Third-Party products provided as part of the Services. These products may contain technical defects, security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, or stability problems. The Provider offers no warranty regarding these Third-Party products, including but not limited to, any associated software, systems, applications, etc.,
2. The use of Third-Party products by the CLIENT is strictly limited to the scope of the Services provided. It is expressly prohibited for the CLIENT to decompile, access source code, or reinstall software or systems provided as Third-Party products on other infrastructure. Full responsibility for the use of Third-Party products lies with the CLIENT, who must ensure their suitability for specific needs and objectives, while adhering to the terms of the Contract.

### Continuity and Reversibility of Services

The termination of Services, for any reason (such as contract termination, non-renewal, client-initiated service shutdown, breach of contract terms, etc.), as well as certain upgrade or reinstallation operations, result in the permanent and irreversible deletion of all Content (including information, data, files, systems, applications, websites, and other elements) that the CLIENT has reproduced, stored, hosted, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise utilized or exploited within the context of Services, including any backups.

### Vulnerability Testing

The CLIENT is authorized to conduct vulnerability tests (hereinafter "Vulnerability Tests") on the provided services. These tests can only be performed after signing an audit agreement involving all parties involved in service provision, including the CLIENT, the auditor, the Service Provider, and any subcontractors. The tests must comply with current legislation and require prior consent from users and rights holders in the tested domain.

The specifics of conducting these Vulnerability Tests by an external auditor will be outlined in a separate contract between the CLIENT and this auditor, incorporating the obligations stated in this article. The CLIENT commits to ensuring adherence to these conditions by the auditor, who acts under the CLIENT's responsibility.

Vulnerability Tests must not:

- Target other infrastructure or services of the Service Provider and/or non-exclusively used by the CLIENT,
- Disrupt optimal functioning of Services, infrastructure, and networks provided by the Service Provider,
- Impact systems, resources, networks, and infrastructures made available by the Service Provider to other clients.

Any intrusion into systems used by other clients is strictly prohibited. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for consequences arising from Vulnerability Tests, including those resulting from actions taken by an external auditor. It is the CLIENT's duty to perform all necessary backups before tests to ensure system restoration in case of incidents.

It should be noted that security mechanisms against spam, DOS/DDOS attacks, and others will remain active during testing, potentially causing temporary service unavailability. The CLIENT must inform any parties affected by this downtime. Upon completion of the Vulnerability Tests, an audit report will be prepared and made available to the Service Provider upon request or when pertinent (e.g., in case vulnerabilities are discovered).

This audit report, its content, and all information gathered or disclosed during the audit are strictly confidential and must not be published or shared without the written authorization of the Service Provider. In violation of established conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right to immediately suspend access to Services, without prejudice to potential damage claims.

## Collaboration

The Parties acknowledge an obligation of cooperation. Consequently, they agree to communicate all relevant information and documents necessary for the performance of this Contract, particularly their respective obligations.

### Liability

This section outlines the responsibilities and liabilities associated with the implementation and operation of cloud computing systems, IT infrastructure, and software development projects. It emphasizes adherence to legal, ethical, and quality standards, ensuring data security, compliance with regulations, and maintaining transparency in processes.

### Service Provider Liability

When the Contract specifies service level agreements (SLAs), the penalties or credits provided by the Service Provider to the Client serve as a fixed compensation for any damage resulting from non-compliance with these SLAs. Consequently, the Client waives all other claims, demands, or actions related to this matter. If no applicable SLA exists, the maximum repairable amount attributable to the Service Provider is limited to the total sums paid by the Client for services affected within three (3) months preceding the indemnification request.

**Exclusion of Liability Clause:** The Service Provider's liability shall not be assumed in the following instances:

- Misuse of services contrary to Contract terms;
- Failure, delay, malfunction, or unavailability of services due to a third party (other than the Prestataire's subcontractors), Client, third-party product, or Client negligence;
- Indirect damages such as commercial harm, loss of orders, decreased activity, reputational damage, loss of profits or clients, including but not limited to, accidental disclosure of confidential information, third-party legal actions, etc.;
- Unauthorized use, disclosure, or misuse of Client user authentication credentials, attributable to the Client or third parties;
- Suspension of access to services or temporary/permanent interruption, in accordance with Article 6 "Terms of Use," including requests from administrative or judicial authorities;
- Loss, alteration, or destruction of hosted content on the infrastructure, within the limits of the Service Provider's responsibility for Client uptime, including backups;
- Inadequacy of services to meet Client needs (especially concerning data sensitivity);
- Security incidents related to internet usage, particularly in cases involving loss, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access to Client data on or from the internet network;
- Deterioration of systems, applications, and other elements installed by the Client on the infrastructure.

### CLIENT RESPONSIBILITY

The CLIENT is solely responsible for all risks associated with its activities, including the use of Services provided by the Prestataire and full compliance with the terms of the Contract. This responsibility extends to cases where Services are used directly by the CLIENT or on behalf of third parties.

Specifically, the CLIENT is accountable for:

- Ensuring that chosen Services meet its requirements and those of any third parties it represents;
- Managing Contents - information, data, files, systems, applications, software, websites, etc., reproduced, hosted, installed, collected, transmitted, disseminated, published, or otherwise utilized within the Services' scope.

- Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and any professional code of conduct;
- Adherence to PGSSI-S (General Information Security Policy for Health Information Systems) if the rendered service involves health data, in accordance with requirement 4.5.2 of the HDS reference framework.

When the CLIENT uses Services for commercial purposes or acts on behalf of third parties, it commits to obtaining professional liability insurance from a recognized insurer, covering all potential damages attributable to it. It also pledges to maintain this insurance (or any equivalent coverage) active throughout the Contract's duration.

### Guarantee

Each Party agrees to conduct its activities in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations. THE CLIENT releases the Provider from any liability and commits to protect it against any consequence arising from:

- The use or exploitation of Illicit Contents via the Services;
- Any fraudulent or non-compliant use of the Services, in accordance with existing regulations;
- Any violation of third parties' rights through the use of the Services;

THE CLIENT further pledges to actively participate in managing any request, claim, or legal action involving Contents or Contract terms, including those from administrative or judicial authorities, and commits to indemnify the Provider for all resulting damages, encompassing any potential penalties, as well as justified defense costs.

### Third Parties

In the context of this Agreement, the Provider assumes no obligation with respect to third parties, including Users, and any clause shall not be interpreted as granting third parties any beneficial rights. The CLIENT assumes full responsibility for its interactions with third parties, particularly with Services Users, and agrees to indemnify the Provider for any claim, demand, or action by third parties that could challenge the quality or compliance of the Services provided by the Provider.

The CLIENT further obligates itself to promptly inform the Provider, in writing, of any claim, demand, or action by third parties concerning the Provider's Services, providing a detailed description of the request along with all relevant information enabling the Provider to furnish the CLIENT with responses or documents that it holds.

## Force Majeure

The performance of any obligation, whether contractual, is suspended in the event it becomes impossible due to a case of force majeure as defined by Article 1218 of the Civil Code.

Initially, cases of force majeure will suspend the execution of the Contract. In the event that a force majeure prevents the Service Provider from fulfilling their obligations:

- Upon the occurrence of an event constituting a force majeure, Cloud Tempe will promptly contact the CLIENT to collaboratively explore solutions for resuming Services and agree on the implementation details of these solutions. This must be completed no later than 48 hours after the occurrence of the event defining the force majeure;
- If the duration of this replacement exceeds thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the event constituting the force majeure, or if the Parties cannot agree on a replacement solution within that same period, the CLIENT may then assign the Services, subject to the Contract, to another Service Provider at their discretion. This would include the Phase of Reversibility, as permitted by the nature, gravity, and impact of the force majeure;
- Conversely, if the Service Provider fails to execute its obligations within thirty (30) calendar days from the occurrence of the event defining the force majeure, despite the cessation of the force majeure, the Contract will resume normal execution.

Should the force majeure persist beyond thirty (30) calendar days, either Party may terminate the Contract upon sending a registered letter to the other Party.

All costs associated with implementing these solutions will fall on the Party affected by the force majeure.

### Financial Conditions

This section outlines the financial terms and conditions of our agreement. It includes details on payment schedules, currency, tax implications, and any other relevant financial aspects. Please review these conditions carefully to ensure full understanding before proceeding.

### Applied Fees

The applied fees for the Services provided to the CLIENT correspond to the current prices at the time of invoice issuance, in accordance with the terms agreed upon in the Contract. Unless otherwise specified, these prices are expressed in euros. The Provider offers various pricing structures for its Services, which may include, where applicable, a minimum engagement period and/or a dedicated billing method. For a given Service offering multiple pricing options, the CLIENT is free to select the option that best suits their needs when placing their order.

The mentioned prices are net of taxes for services intended for professionals, meaning that VAT and any other applicable taxes (excluding the Provider's own revenue taxes) will be added to the billed amount. This additional imposition does not constitute a price modification as per the article on tariff revision conditions.

Beyond specific pricing details, the cost of Services also encompasses acquisition fees for licenses and usage rights of tools, software, and operating systems utilized by the Provider or, if applicable, made available to the CLIENT through the Services. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to acquire and pay for any necessary licenses or usage rights required for the operation of content accessed via the Services.

The pricing structure of Services and the units of measurement used for their calculation are accessible on the Provider's website. It is recommended that the CLIENT review these details prior to confirming their order. Any partial unit of measurement is due in full, even if not fully consumed. Additionally, certain Services may incur extra costs for installation or activation.

### Price Change Notification

The Provider reserves the right to adjust its prices at its discretion. Any price change will apply immediately to future orders placed after the adjustment. For subscribed services, any tariff increase will be communicated to the CLIENT with a 30-day (30 calendar day) notice via email.

Following this notification, the CLIENT has 30 calendar days to cancel the affected services without incurring penalties. This cancellation can be made either by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt or through a specific form available within the CLIENT's Management Interface. In the absence of cancellation within this period, the CLIENT is deemed to have accepted the new prices. It's crucial to note that the option for penalty-free cancellation does not apply in cases where price increases are due to unforeseen circumstances as defined by Article 1195 of the Civil Code. In such scenarios, the terms specified in this article will apply.

### Billing

Billing for the Services is based on actual usage and orders placed by the CLIENT, recorded in the Provider's information system, which is considered reliable and authoritative in case of disputes with the CLIENT. The billing frequency (monthly, annually, or another specified period) and timing (at order or upon delivery) vary depending on the specific Service. Billing terms are determined according to the technical and commercial offer validated by both the CLIENT and the Provider. Any partial period is billed at the prorata. It is the CLIENT's responsibility to familiarize themselves with these conditions prior to placing an order. Upon settlement of each invoice, the Provider sends the CLIENT a payment receipt.

The CLIENT explicitly accepts the receipt of invoices electronically, which are sent to the email address provided by the CLIENT. The CLIENT is responsible for maintaining a copy of every invoice received, in compliance with applicable legal requirements.

### Overdue and Late Payment

Except for a good-faith contest by the CLIENT regarding any part or all of the invoice, in case of non-payment or delay in payment (including partial payments), the following consequences shall apply:

1. Late payment penalties will be immediately exigible from the day after the due date, calculated at an interest rate equivalent to three times the legal rate.
2. Any persistent delay or default in payment of amounts due by the CLIENT under the Contract, lasting more than seven (7) calendar days following the sending of a payment default notice via email, will automatically:

   - Make the entire outstanding amount due from the CLIENT under the Contract immediately payable, regardless of the initially agreed payment method.
   - Allow the Service Provider to immediately and without prior notice or formalities suspend all or part of the Services provided to the CLIENT (including those already paid), refuse any new Order or renewal of Services, and unilaterally terminate the Contract in full or in part via email.

Furthermore, in case of payment delay or default, professional clients are required to pay a fixed penalty of forty (40) euros for collection fees, without prejudice to the Service Provider's right to demand additional compensation, upon presentation of documentation, if the collection costs exceed this fixed amount.

### Contestation

Any dispute concerning billing or specifics of the Services must be addressed to the Prestataire's Service CLIENT via the CLIENT's Management Interface, within a maximum of one (1) month following the invoice date. Beyond this period, the CLIENT remains obligated to settle outstanding amounts in accordance with the Contract terms, despite any future contestation of the invoice. In case an accounting error is identified, the Prestataire reserves the right to make necessary adjustments on the affected invoices, adhering to applicable statutes of limitations.

### Penalties

This section outlines the various penalties that may be imposed in case of non-compliance with the terms and conditions outlined in this document. These penalties are designed to ensure adherence to the stipulated rules and regulations, thereby maintaining a secure and efficient environment for all users involved.

1. **Warning**:
   - A verbal or written warning will be issued for minor violations of the terms. This serves as an initial cautionary measure, emphasizing the importance of compliance without resorting to immediate penalties.

2. **Temporary Suspension**:
   - For repeated minor infractions or significant but non-critical breaches, users may face a temporary suspension from accessing certain features or services. This allows for a cooling-off period and encourages corrective action before full access is restored.

3. **Account Suspension/Termination**:
   - Persistent or severe violations, especially those affecting system integrity or user safety, can lead to account suspension or termination. This serves as the most stringent measure, ensuring that users who repeatedly disregard rules do not continue to pose risks to the platform's stability and security.

4. **Monetary Fines**:
   - In cases where penalties are imposed for commercial entities or repeated violations by individuals, monetary fines may be levied as a deterrent measure. These fines aim to discourage non-compliance through economic pressure.

5. **Legal Action**:
   - For severe breaches that involve illegal activities or infringement of intellectual property rights, legal action may be pursued. This is reserved for situations where penalties under contractual obligations or local laws are insufficient to address the severity of the offense.

Each penalty type carries specific criteria and thresholds, determined by the governing body responsible for overseeing compliance within this framework. The exact application of these penalties will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of the infractions, as well as the user's history of compliance.

### Principle

Failure to meet the Service Levels outlined in the SecNumCloud Services Convention grants the CLIENT the right to impose penalties. The imposition of penalties will be requested by the CLIENT via email within a maximum 90 (four-and-twenty) day period following the triggering event. In cases where non-compliance is due to the CLIENT's or third party's actions, no penalties will be applicable to the Prestataire.

Penalties will be calculated based on the non-compliant reference indicator. Regardless, the total monthly penalty amount shall not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the monthly Services' value as stated in the invoice. Upon the CLIENT's request for penalty application, the Prestataire's payment of these penalties will serve as a fixed and final indemnity for damages concerning the incidents leading to the penalty.

### Penalty Calculation

**Penalties = Percentage deviation between the availability promised by
SLA of the considered service on the calculation period and the actual
availability of the service on the calculation period.**

***Example: Non-compliance with SLA 1, 3, and 4***

- *SLA 1: IC-INFRA_SNC-01 -- Compute Availability: 99.9%; current month's
    rate is 90%; penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**
- *SLA 3: IC-INFRA_SNC-03 -- Backup: 99.9%; current month's rate is 80%;
    penalty rate to be applied **19.9%**
- *SLA 4: IC-INFRA-SNC-05 -- Internet Access: 99.9%; current month's rate is 90%;
    penalty rate to be applied **9.9%**

In all cases, penalties under the present Sales and Usage Conditions do not exceed 30% (thirty percent) of the amount of services concerned on the invoice for the month. Furthermore, penalties are always a fixed, final indemnity for damages regardless of the incident causing the penalties, which have a redemptive nature.

Penalties will be applied as a credit of the regular service's value for the following month. If any penalties remain due at contract termination, regardless of cause, the Service Provider will settle the deficit with the CLIENT through bank transfer.

### Rescission

This section outlines the process and conditions for terminating the agreement between the parties involved. It includes details on notice periods, consequences of early termination, and any applicable fees or penalties. The specifics may vary depending on the contract's terms, but generally, it will cover:

1. **Notice Period**: The required duration before either party can initiate the resumption of rights under the agreement.
2. **Grounds for Rescission**: Reasons that justify termination, such as breach of contract by one party or non-payment of fees.
3. **Effects of Termination**: How the termination affects ongoing obligations, including settlement of outstanding duties and responsibilities.
4. **Fees and Penalties**: Any charges or compensations due to either party upon termination, such as early termination fees or penalties for non-compliance.
5. **Post-Termination Obligations**: Responsibilities that remain after the agreement is terminated, including data return, confidentiality clauses, and non-compete agreements.

It's crucial to carefully review this section to understand the implications of terminating the agreement prematurely or under specific conditions.

### Termination for Convenience

The CLIENT is authorized to terminate the Contract at any time after a one-month period from the activation date of the Contract, without needing justification or incurring penalties. To do so, the CLIENT must notify termination via registered mail with request for receipt addressed to the Service Provider.

A two-month notice period is mandatory. Termination becomes effective at the end of this period. Services provided by the Service Provider up until the effective date of termination will be billed according to the Contract terms, without any additional compensation. However, the CLIENT remains responsible for paying all outstanding amounts due for the full duration of the Contract, including equipment and license fees that were invoiced on a monthly basis.

### Breach of Contract Termination

In the event that either party fails to fulfill an essential obligation stipulated in the Agreement, the affected party will issue a formal notice by certified mail with return receipt requesting that the defaulting party correct the situation within thirty (30) business days from the date of notification.

Should the defaulting party fail to rectify their breach beyond this period, the aggrieved party is entitled to terminate the Agreement by sending another formal notice via certified mail with return receipt. This termination will occur without any compensation being provided to the defaulting party, while reserving the right to claim damages for the suffered losses.

The decision to terminate the Agreement due to breach imposes liability on the initiating party. In a scenario where it is established that the party subject to termination did not actually fail in their obligations, the party instigating the termination would be obligated to compensate the other party for any damages incurred.

### Termination Without Cause

Each party reserves the right to terminate the Contract without notice or compensation under the following circumstances, by sending registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt:

1. In case of insolvency filing by the other party, unless the judicial administrator decides to continue the Contract within the legal period.
2. If there is a change in control at the other party's end, as per Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, resulting in direct or indirect ownership by a competitor of the party invoking termination.
3. The non-execution of the Contract by the other party for more than thirty (30) calendar days due to unforeseen circumstances constituting a force majeure.
4. An unexpected change in circumstances at the time of Contract signing, significantly altering its economic balance.
5. Excessive and repeated abuse by the CLIENT of the liability clause without justification, placing the Prestataire in a financially precarious position or making the Contract non-profitable.

Upon expiration or for any other reason for Contract termination:

- The CLIENT is authorized to initiate the phase of reversibility as per the provisions outlined in "Reversibility" article;
- The Prestataire must ensure secure deletion of all CLIENT's data according to specified procedures;
- This secure deletion involves secure removal of all media containing these data, in accordance with the terms of the Service Convention. Post Contract conclusion, regardless of termination reason, the Prestataire is also responsible for erasing technical data associated with the CLIENT final, including directory, certificates, and access configuration settings.

## Reversibility

The Services do not have an obligation of reversibility (i.e., the Client's ability to migrate their system to another Provider) except for the provision by the Provider to the Client of the technical interface and APIs enabling the Client to back up and retrieve their data, including configuration data of platforms via one of the following technical modalities at the Client's discretion:

1. Providing files in a documented and externally exploitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).
2. Setting up technical interfaces allowing access to data according to a documented and exploitable schema (API).

The Client, being the sole owner of its System, must take all necessary measures to facilitate this migration process as needed (which may involve, among other things, meticulous documentation) and the development of a Reversibility Plan. In case the Client requires additional services, the Provider may offer consulting work in this area under a separate, negotiable contract.

## Confidentiality

The Parties agree that all information exchanged between them, whether during negotiations or the execution of the Contract, are considered Confidential Information, regardless of their form or medium. This includes, but is not limited to, any information related to the Contract itself, as well as personal data, scientific, technical, technological, commercial, social, financial, legal, or information from any other domain, susceptible of protection by patent or otherwise. Among these, one finds plans, drawings, specifications, processes, know-how, designs, methods, studies, forecasts of needs, software/applications, as well as information concerning prospects, client/partner names.

These Confidential Information can be transmitted directly or indirectly to the other Party, regardless of form (oral, written), type of documents (paper or digital), and through any communication means. To enhance their confidentiality:

- Specific mentions will be affixed on communication supports.
- A reminder of confidentiality will be systematically provided during each exchange, with date indication and reference to this confidentiality obligation.

The absence of such mentions or reminders does not affect the Confidential Information's nature or the Parties' confidentiality obligations.

Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Is already public without any fault on the receiving Party's part;
- Was known to the receiving Party before communication by the transmitting Party, as attested by the receiving Party's records;
- Is received legitimately from a third party without confidentiality restrictions;
- Is developed independently by the receiving Party without references to Confidential Information.

Confidential Information must be strictly protected by the Parties and used solely for Contract execution. The Parties commit to:

- Using Confidential Information exclusively within the scope of the Contract;
- Limiting disclosure of Confidential Information to their team members involved in Contract execution, ensuring these individuals are bound by confidentiality;
- Preserving the content's confidentiality of the Contract;
- Not disclosing Confidential Information to third parties without written prior consent from the other Party, except for legal or judicial necessity;
- Protecting physically the Confidential Information by storing it in secure locations and implementing necessary security measures.

These confidentiality commitments remain in effect throughout the Contract's duration and for five (5) years post-Contract conclusion/cancellation. Upon Contract termination, Parties agree to return or destroy all Confidential Information, without retaining any copies, unless otherwise instructed by the transmitting Party.

The Service Provider ensures these confidentiality principles are adhered to by all subcontractors during the Contract period.

## Subcontracting

The Provider shall comply with the mandatory provisions of French Law No. 75-1334 of December 31, 1975 on subcontracting, and will be responsible to the CLIENT for any failure to fulfill obligations stipulated by this law. The use of Subcontractors in no way reduces the Provider's responsibility to the CLIENT under the Contract; the Provider remains fully liable for carrying out the subcontracted services towards the CLIENT and, generally, for the proper execution of the Contract.

## Assignment of Contract

The Parties agree that the Contract was concluded intuitu personae.
Therefore, none of the Parties can assign or transfer any part of the Contract to a third party without the prior written agreement of the other Party, particularly in cases of change of control (as defined by articles L. 233-1 or L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or partial asset disposal.
By way of exception to the above, each Party is authorized to assign or transfer the Contract within its group, provided that it informs the other Party at least 30 days prior to the assignment or transfer operation.

## Labor Law Compliance

The Provider asserts that it adheres to the provisions of Articles L.8211-1, L.8221-1 and subsequently, L.8524-1 to L.8254-4, as well as those of Articles L.8251-1 and subsequently of the Labor Code, concerning the individuals it employs.

Under these conditions and in compliance with the provisions of Articles L.8221-1 and L.8524-1 to L.8254-4 of the Labor Code, the Provider will deliver to the CLIENT, upon request, the following:

- The complete set of documents required by Article D.8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- An honor pledge regarding the fight against hidden labor.

The Provider further commits to upholding these obligations with all subcontractors engaged under this contract's duration. For services provided within the CLIENT's premises, the Provider guarantees that its employees will adhere to all hygiene and safety regulations applicable at the CLIENT's location, in accordance with Decree No. 92-158 of February 20, 1992, which outlines specific hygiene and safety precautions for work performed by an external company (Articles R.4511-1 to R.4515-11 of the Labor Code).

Both parties will be informed about any potential difficulties related to these matters and the methods to address them. This Contract exclusively covers staffing arrangements under temporary labor regulations, excluding any form of on-site personnel provision.

The Provider's workforce remains perpetually subject to the exclusive legal jurisdiction of the Provider, who holds sole authority for direction and control over its employees. The CLIENT is prohibited from issuing direct orders to the Provider's staff or those of its subcontractors.

The Provider assumes full responsibility for its personnel's social security affiliation with all relevant institutions and complete liability concerning labor law compliance. To this end, the Provider confirms having fulfilled all required declarations to social protection bodies and refrains from engaging in hidden work as defined by Articles L.8221-3 and 5 of the Labor Code. Should a subcontractor be employed, the Provider guarantees strict adherence to the legal stipulations mentioned above.

In accordance with prevention and suppression regulations for hidden labor, the Provider commits to delivering to the CLIENT at the Contract's signing date and every six months until contract completion:

- An honor pledge of filing all mandatory tax declarations with the relevant authorities on the declaration date, along with the receipt of filing;
- A social security declaration from the organization responsible for collecting labor contributions and social security dues due to the Provider, issued no more than six months prior;
- An excerpt from the commercial register (K or K-bis for the Provider) or a document conforming to Article D.8222-5 of the Labor Code;
- An honor pledge by the Provider confirming that work was performed by regularly employed staff in accordance with Articles L.1221-10, L.3243-2, and R.3243-1 of the Labor Code.

## Ethics and Social Responsibility

In the execution of this Contract, both Parties agree to strictly adhere to the following ethical principles and legal requirements:

- Absolute prohibition against employing minors, forced labor, or any form of compulsory work, in accordance with International Labour Organization (ILO) directives;
- Eradication of all forms of discrimination, whether based on gender, race, color, social origin, religion, political opinion, sexual orientation, disability, or any other condition, in compliance with applicable laws.
- Combat against corruption in all its forms, ensuring complete integrity and transparency in all operations.

The Service Provider firmly commits to upholding and promoting the fundamental values of the European Union, including human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, respect for the rule of law, and human rights, encompassing those of minorities. This commitment is manifested through continuous vigilance and action aimed at ensuring these principles are respected across all aspects of their operations.

## Intellectual Property

This Agreement does not constitute any transfer or assignment of intellectual property and/or industrial property rights, including patents. It is expressly prohibited for the CLIENT to:

- Copy or reproduce in any manner the elements used for service provision, including but not limited to computer code, text, images, designs, graphical charts, ergonomics, documentation, etc.
- Attempt to decompose, disassemble, or apply any form of reverse engineering to the Prestataire's proprietary technologies.

Despite these restrictions, the Prestataire grants the CLIENT a non-transferable, non-exclusive right to use said elements solely for the purpose of using the Services and during the duration thereof. This authorization to use expires automatically upon completion of service provision.

## Non-Solicitation of Personnel

Unless prior written consent is obtained, each Party agrees not to hire or engage directly or indirectly any employee of the other Party during the term of this Agreement extended by an additional one (1) year from the date of termination.

Any breach of the above obligation by either Party will result in automatic payment by the breaching Party of a fixed and irrecoverable penalty equal to twelve (12) months of gross salary (fixed and variable) of the affected employee, as determined by reference to the average salary over the three (3) preceding months prior to the termination date.

## Distinctive Marks of the Parties

Each Party agrees to refrain from any action or act that could directly or indirectly infringe upon the distinctive marks of the other Party, and particularly its trademarks. This prohibition does not preclude either the Service Provider citing the CLIENT for reference purposes and the CLIENT mentioning that it utilizes the Service Provider's offerings. However, each Party, without necessitating a reason, may inform the other Party that it no longer wishes to be cited.

## Personal Data

The CLIENT agrees to adhere to the Prestataire's data protection policy as outlined in these GVU (General Terms and Conditions). The CLIENT can request this policy at the following address:

```
dpo@cloud-temple.fr
```

Both the CLIENT and the Prestataire commit to complying with applicable data protection regulations, particularly the French law no. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 concerning computer files and freedoms (as amended) and the EU Regulation no. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016, applicable from May 25, 2018 onwards.

## Data Protection Insurance

Should the CLIENT intend to process critical or strategic data (such as billing, payroll, R&D information, etc.) utilizing our services, it is the CLIENT's responsibility to secure dedicated data protection insurance for covering potential data loss.

## Assignment of Competence and Applicable Law

The Contract shall be governed by French law.

For any dispute arising between the Parties regarding the execution or termination of the Contract, the Parties will first attempt to resolve it amicably. In case of failure, the dispute will be submitted to the Commercial Court of Nanterre, regardless of multiple defendants or sureties, even for preliminary procedures, referrals, or requests, in full.
