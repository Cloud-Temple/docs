# QuickStart for the Cloud Temple Marketplace

This page guides you through the initial steps to use the **Cloud Temple Marketplace** from the console. Follow these instructions to explore available solutions and deploy them quickly.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following points are met:

1. **Active Subscription**: To enable deployments, your organization must have subscribed to at least one Cloud Temple service (OpenSource IaaS or VMware IaaS). During contact with our partners, no specific subscription is required.
2. **User Permissions**: Your user account must have the necessary permissions to access the console and write permissions on target environments when deploying resources.
3. **Target Environment**: Have a tenant configured for deploying solutions.

## Access to the Marketplace

### 1. Access from the Shiva Console

Once connected to the Cloud Temple console, you can access the Marketplace in several ways:

- **Main Menu**: A **Marketplace** menu is available in the main navigation
- **Virtual Machines Pages**: The Marketplace is also accessible from the virtual machine creation pages within OpenIaaS and VMware environments

### 2. Marketplace Page

The Marketplace page displays a catalog of available solutions. Each solution shows:

- **Name and logo** of the solution  
- **Short description**  
- **Publisher/Partner**  
- **Solution type** (VM Image, SaaS Solution, etc.)
