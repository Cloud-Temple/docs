This **Quickstart Housing** guide helps you get started quickly with Cloud Temple's physical hosting offer. It covers the essential steps to request hosting, configure your equipment, and benefit from additional services.

## Step 1: Submit a Hosting Request

1. Access the Cloud Temple console.
2. Open a service ticket by providing:
   - Name of your organization.
   - Contact details (email and phone).
   - Desired type of hosting (shared at 'U' or dedicated by rack).
   - Quantity and characteristics of the equipment (size, weight, power consumption, etc.).

## Step 2: Prepare Your Equipment

- Ensure your equipment meets the technical constraints:
  - Size in rack units (U).
  - Maximum weight per 'U' (25kg for shared, up to 1000kg for a dedicated rack).
  - Power consumption (150W to 3Kw depending on the subscribed option).

## Step 3: Configure Network Connectivity

1. Select the required port type:
   - Copper 1Gbps.
   - Fiber 1Gbps or 10Gbps.
2. Add connectivity options in the Meet Me Room if necessary for operator integration.

## Step 4: Activate Hands & Eyes Services

If needed, request technical assistance for:
- Installing your equipment.
- Configuring cabling.
- Performing occasional actions (rebooting, photos, etc.).

## Step 5: Validate the Installation

Once your equipment is installed, check their connectivity and proper functioning directly via the Cloud Temple console or in coordination with support.
