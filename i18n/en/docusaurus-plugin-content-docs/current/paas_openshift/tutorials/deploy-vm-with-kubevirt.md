title: Deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) with KubeVirt
---

## Objectives

This tutorial aims to provide clear steps to deploy and configure virtual machines (VMs) in **KubeVirt** on your OpenShift cluster. 

Two scenarios will be addressed:

1. Creating and deploying a Fedora VM with NGINX.
2. Creating a customized Windows Server 2022 VM with IIS.

---

## Known Limitations

- Missing templates in the OpenShift catalog can be retrieved from the official KubeVirt repository:  
  [https://github.com/kubevirt/common-templates/tree/master](https://github.com/kubevirt/common-templates/tree/master).  
- Deployed VMs must be compatible with KubeVirt (virtio drivers, disk formats, etc.).
- Configuration depends on the privileges assigned in the corresponding OpenShift project.
- Advanced network configuration (e.g., port forwarding) is required to access services hosted on the VMs.

---

## Key Features

- **Flexibility**: Enables deploying VMs directly from OpenShift, simplifying hosting applications requiring a VM environment.  
- **Windows and Linux Compatibility**: Supports Fedora and Windows Server.  
- **Ease of Integration**: Uses inherent KubeVirt and OpenShift services (PVC, port forwarding, ingress).  

---

## Software Versions

- OpenShift: v4.15 or higher  
- Kubernetes: v1.24 or higher  
- KubeVirt: v0.56 or higher  
- VMware Workstation (for Windows Server conversion): Version 16 or higher  
- qemu-img: Version 6.1 or higher  

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. KubeVirt correctly installed in OpenShift.  
2. Administrator access to the OpenShift project where the VM will be deployed.  
3. SSH keys to access the Fedora VM.  
4. The following tools installed and configured:  
   - **OpenShift CLI (`oc`)**  
   - **qemu-img** (for converting disks to `qcow2` format)  
5. Access to an Azure blob where the Windows Server image will be stored.  

---

## Demonstration Plan

### Overview of Steps

1. Deploy a Fedora VM with NGINX.  
2. Deploy a Windows Server VM with IIS.  
3. Configure network access (SSH for Fedora, RDP for Windows).  
4. Verify that the services (NGINX/IIS) are accessible from your browser.  

---

## Required Files

You will need the following files for deployment:

1. **ssh-port-forward.yaml**: Manifest to configure SSH access to the Fedora VM.  
2. **nginx-expose.yaml**: Manifest to expose NGINX in OpenShift.  
3. **rdp-port-forward.yaml**: Manifest to configure RDP access to the Windows VM.  
4. **iis-expose.yaml**: Manifest to expose IIS in OpenShift.  

---

## Deployment Process

---

### Step 1: Deploy a Fedora VM with NGINX

1. **Create a Fedora VM in OpenShift**:  

   - Go to the **Administrator** view in OpenShift and select **Virtualization**.
   - Navigate to the **Catalog** tab and click **Create a New VM**.
   - Fill in the following parameters:  
     - **Operating System**: Fedora  
     - **Instance Type**: U Series with **2 CPUs and 8 GB RAM**  
     - **VM Name**: `fedora-nginx`  
   - Add your public SSH key (`mysshkey`) to access the VM.
   - Click **Create**.  

2. **Configure CLI access to OpenShift**:  

   - Enter the following command to work on the correct OpenShift project:  

     ```bash
     oc project demokubevirt
     ```

   - Log in to the OpenShift API:  

     ```bash
     oc login --server=api-ocp01-{your-id}.paas.cloud-temple.com --web
     ```

3. **Configure SSH access to the Fedora VM**:  

   - Apply the manifest to configure SSH port forwarding:  

     ```bash
     oc apply -f ssh-port-forward.yaml
     ```

   - Forward the port locally from your machine:  

     ```bash
     oc port-forward svc/fedora-service-ssh 2222:22
     ```

   - Connect to the VM from a new terminal:  

     ```bash
     ssh cloud-user@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
     ```

4. **Deploy NGINX on Fedora**:  

   - Connect to the VM as above and run the following commands:  

     ```bash
     sudo dnf update -y 
     sudo dnf install nginx -y
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
     ```

   - Verify that NGINX is working correctly:  

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status nginx
     ```

5. **Expose NGINX in OpenShift**:  

   - Apply the following manifest to expose the service:  

     ```bash
     oc apply -f nginx-expose.yaml
     ```

6. **Access the NGINX website**:  

   - Open your browser and go to:  
     `https://nginx-fedora.apps-ocp01-{your-id}.paas.cloud-temple.com`.

### Step 2: Deploy a Windows Server VM with IIS

1. **Create a custom Windows image**:  

   - Install a Windows Server VM in VMware Workstation with:  
     - Drivers: **Virtio**, SATA, e1000e, UEFI.  
     - Perform a **Sysprep**.
     - Export the image in **OVF** format.  

   - Convert the disk image to **qcow2** format using `qemu-img`:  

     ```bash
     qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 WindowsServer2022-OC-disk1.vmdk output.qcow2
     ```

   - Upload the converted image to an Azure blob and retrieve the SAS key.  

2. **Create a custom template for Windows Server in KubeVirt**:  

   - From the **Catalog** tab in OpenShift, create a template with the following parameters:  
     - **2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB storage**.  
     - Configure storage to use **virtio**.  
     - Use the blob URL as the disk source and include the SAS key.  

3. **Configure IIS on Windows**:  

   - Connect to the VM (administrator password, keyboard, etc.).
   - Install **IIS** in the console:  

     ```powershell
     Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
     ```

4. **Configure RDP access**:  

   - Apply the following YAML files:  

     ```bash
     oc apply -f rdp-port-forward.yaml
     oc apply -f iis-expose.yaml
     ```

   - Forward the RDP port locally:  

     ```bash
     oc port-forward svc/windows-service-rdp 2222:3389
     ```

   - Connect via your RDP client:  

     ```bash
     mstsc -v 127.0.0.1:2222
     ```

5. **Access the IIS website**:  

   - In your browser, go to:  
     `https://iis-windows.apps-ocp01-{your-id}.paas.cloud-temple.com`.

## Validation Criteria

1. The Fedora and Windows Server VMs are deployed without errors.  
2. SSH on Fedora and RDP on Windows work via port forwarding.  
3. The NGINX and IIS services are publicly accessible via the configured URLs.

## Conclusion

This guide has enabled you to deploy Fedora and Windows Server VMs on KubeVirt with OpenShift. You have learned how to configure network access (SSH/RDP) and expose web services. These steps can be replicated for various scenarios where VMs are required in the **Cloud Temple** OpenShift PaaS environment. ðŸš€
