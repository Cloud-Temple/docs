## Overall Platform Architecture

### Overview

The Red Hat OpenShift platform from Cloud Temple is designed as a regional offering, natively deployed across **three distinct Availability Zones** within the same [region](../additional_content/concepts_regional.md) of Cloud Temple. This three-zone architecture significantly enhances data availability and resilience.

The platform consists of a control plane and worker nodes, both managed by the Cloud Temple infrastructure. The control plane is evenly distributed across the three Availability Zones, ensuring centralized and secure management. Worker nodes, in turn, are represented by compute blades, arranged so that each Availability Zone contains one.

For worker nodes, several types of compute blades are available, enabling flexible adaptation to various operational requirements:

| Red Hat OpenShift 4 with Data Foundations - On Demand - 1 Month | Unit | SKU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| OPENSHIFT - Control Plane - 3 Nodes - Region FR1 | 1 dedicated plan | csp:fr1:paas:oshift:plan:payg:v1 |

| OPENSHIFT - WORKER NODES - GPU - 3 x (32 cores / 64 threads - 512 GB RAM - 512 GiB FLASH 1500 IOPS - 2x NVIDIA L40S 48GB) | 3 dedicated workers + GPUs | csp:fr1:paas:oshift:wkr:gpu:payg:v1 |

Cloud Temple’s Red Hat OpenShift offerings are available either on a pay-as-you-go basis or through a 12-month reservation.

**Notes**:

1. *Maintaining the control plane in operational and secure condition is the responsibility of Cloud Temple as part of its PaaS service.*

2. *As of June 15, 2024, version 1 of the platform is intentionally software-limited to a maximum of 30 worker nodes (regardless of worker type) and a total persistent storage capacity of 50 TiB. If these limits are restrictive for your project, please contact support.*

3. *Each worker node comes with 512 GiB of block flash storage, resulting in 1.5 TiB per unit of work (1 worker per AZ).*

4. *By default, a worker node can manage up to 250 pods. This number can be adjusted via the `podsPerCore` parameter—for example, with 10 pods per core on a 4-core node, the maximum would be 40 pods. For further technical details, refer to the [OpenShift pod management documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-managing-max-pods.html) and the [OpenShift limits guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.html).*

5. *The PaaS OpenShift offering includes native access to the three Availability Zones—no additional subscription is required.*

6. *It is possible to add block storage to the OpenShift cluster at a later stage.*

7. *Nodes are deployed evenly across the three Availability Zones (1 node per zone). It is not possible to imbalance a cluster by assigning more nodes to a single zone.*

## Backup Strategy for Your Openshift PaaS Platform

Backing up and restoring the Openshift PaaS platform is the responsibility of Cloud Temple for the **ETCD** component, as part of platform management. **Backup and restoration of application deployment and data are the responsibility of the Client.**

Cloud Temple provides its customers with the **Veeam Kasten K10** solution (Veeam [**Kasten K10**](https://www.veeam.com/fr/kubernetes-native-backup-and-restore.html)), a platform specialized in data management for Kubernetes environments. Designed to meet data protection requirements, it offers robust features for backup, restore, migration, and disaster recovery. Kasten K10 integrates natively with Kubernetes environments—whether managed on cloud clusters or on-premises—and adapts to various use cases, including cluster migrations between different Kubernetes distributions such as Vanilla Kubernetes, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat Kubernetes Engine, and Red Hat OpenShift.

One of the primary use cases of Kasten K10 is **migrating clusters across different Kubernetes platforms**. Whether transitioning to a more robust infrastructure or consolidating existing environments, Kasten K10 provides simple and efficient tools to manage these migrations:

- **Backup and data protection**: When migrating a Vanilla Kubernetes or VMware Tanzu cluster to Red Hat Kubernetes Engine or OpenShift, the first step is to back up application data and their states. Kasten K10 seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes APIs to identify applications, their dependencies, and associated data volumes. This includes backing up persistent volumes (Persistent Volumes - PVs), databases, configurations, and secrets. Kasten K10 supports a wide range of storage providers (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc.), enabling snapshots of applications to be created for migration. These backups are securely stored with encryption options and granular access controls, ensuring data security throughout the process.

- **Portability and migration**: Migrating between Kubernetes distributions such as Vanilla or Tanzu and Red Hat solutions like OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine can be complex due to architectural differences and platform-specific configurations. Kasten K10 simplifies this process by providing an abstraction layer for application portability. During migration, Kasten K10 replicates configurations and data from a source cluster to a target cluster while respecting the specificities of each environment. For example, Kubernetes objects such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVs, and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) can be migrated while accounting for constraints inherent to each Kubernetes distribution—whether it's a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine cluster. The process is automated, significantly reducing the risk of manual errors. Additionally, Kasten K10 supports both incremental and full migrations, depending on requirements, and provides real-time visibility into the migration status, facilitating smooth management and monitoring of the transition.

- **Multi-cloud and multi-distribution compatibility**: Kasten K10 is designed to operate in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, making it an ideal tool for organizations looking to migrate applications from Tanzu or Vanilla clusters to Red Hat environments in the cloud (Cloud Temple, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE) or on-premises infrastructures. This ensures maximum flexibility and allows DevOps teams to choose the best environment based on business needs or infrastructure modernization strategies.

- **Simplified management and automation**: Kasten K10 offers an intuitive user interface that enables administrators to easily manage backup and migration operations without requiring deep expertise in each individual Kubernetes platform. The solution also includes automation capabilities that allow users to define recurring backup and migration policies, integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines for continuous operations. Users can schedule migrations or restorations during maintenance windows, perform validation tests after migration, and automate failover processes in case of issues on the source cluster.

- **Security and compliance**: When migrating to critical environments such as Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine, data security and compliance with standards (ISO, SOC, GDPR, etc.) are essential. Kasten K10 ensures encryption of data in transit and at rest, while providing audit trails and traceability for backup and restore operations. These capabilities are crucial to guarantee the security of migrated data, whether in production or test environments. Kasten K10 is an indispensable solution for enterprises aiming to efficiently and securely migrate Vanilla Kubernetes or VMware Tanzu clusters to Red Hat Kubernetes Engine or OpenShift.

Billing is based on the number of worker nodes.

| Redhat Openshift 4 with Data Foundations - Worker Node Backup Solution | Unit | SKU |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--- | :-------------------------- |
| VEEAM - KASTEN K10 - Kubernetes data protection and application mobility              | 3 workers | csp:fr1:paas:kasten:3wkr:v1 |

**Note**: *Please note that the required disk capacity for proper backup operation must be planned in the backup target environment—typically S3 storage. This is not included in the Openshift or Kasten service units.*

**(1)** _OADP is not installed natively in the cluster. Only Kasten is enabled for managing migrations, backups, and restores._

## Load Balancers

The **SecNumCloud OpenShift** environment provides load balancing solutions tailored to multiple functional domains, ensuring secure and optimized traffic management.

Load balancers cover four distinct domains, leveraging different layers of the OSI model:

- **Access to administration tools** (API server and OpenShift console)  
- **Public HTTP/HTTPS traffic**  
- **Private HTTP/HTTPS traffic**  
- **Specialized traffic requiring advanced customization**

### Administrative Tools Access

Access to administrative tools is secured by dedicated load balancers. These are protected by enhanced security controls, including a manageable whitelist accessible via the **Cloud Temple** console, ensuring strict access management.

### Public HTTP/HTTPS Traffic

**Public LoadBalancers**, based on **HAProxy**, operate at **Layer 4** of the OSI model. They enable exposing your workloads over **HTTP/HTTPS** via **routes** and **ingresses**, ensuring efficient and high-performance distribution of incoming traffic.

### Private HTTP/HTTPS Traffic (Interconnection with your SNC IaaS Services)

**Private LoadBalancers** enable communication with your **SNC IaaS services** without public exposure. Like their public counterparts, they distribute **HTTP/HTTPS** traffic while maintaining a secure and isolated environment.

### Specific Traffic

**Specific traffic** is managed through the LoadBalancer **MetalLB**, which supports advanced requirements demanding fine-grained customization, for example:

- Connecting to a database via **TCP**
- Handling **UDP** streams for real-time or low-latency applications
- Routing advanced protocols such as **QUIC** or **MQTT-SN**, providing enhanced flexibility

This solution enables support for your specific traffic flows, whether for private interconnections or public exposure needs.

Routing is performed using dedicated **public and private IP addresses**. By default, you are assigned the following IP addresses for service exposure:

- **4 public IP addresses**
- **254 private IP addresses**

If these resources are insufficient to support your workloads, you may request additional IP addresses—either **public** or **private**—from our support team.

> **Note**: The built-in LoadBalancers do not function as a **WAF**. A **WAF as a Service** solution will be available shortly.

## Security Restrictions and Requirements on OpenShift SecNumCloud

### Dedicated Control Plane  

Running workloads on the **control plane** is strictly prohibited. This restriction ensures the security and stability of the OpenShift platform on **SecNumCloud** by limiting access to critical resources.

### Prohibition of Privileged Containers (Rootless)

To comply with the security requirements of the **SecNumCloud reference framework**, only **rootless containers** are permitted. This approach enhances security by preventing any privileged access to containers.

Applications requiring elevated privileges must be adapted, as their deployment will not be allowed. This restriction also applies to **Helm Charts** and **operators** using non-rootless images, making their use incompatible with the infrastructure.

### Restrictions on ClusterRoles

In our OpenShift offering, access management at the cluster level is strictly governed to ensure **security and compliance** with SecNumCloud.

This entails **restrictions on ClusterRoles**, limiting global privileges. While these restrictions may require technical adjustments, they are essential for enhancing the resilience and stability of the environment.

Our support team is available to assist you in adapting your configurations and advise you on possible alternatives.

### Restrictions on Security Context Constraints (SCC)

**Security Context Constraints (SCC)** are enforced and cannot be modified by users. As a result, container execution parameters (such as access privileges, Linux capabilities, etc.) are predefined and non-customizable.

This restriction aims to prevent unauthorized access to critical cluster resources. Applications requiring specific security contexts must be adapted to comply with the existing SCCs.

From an operational standpoint, this may require architectural adjustments and modifications to deployment processes, particularly for **Helm Charts** and **operators** that do not adhere to these constraints.

### Limitations on Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

To ensure **SecNumCloud compliance**, the use of **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** and custom controllers is restricted.

This measure, tied to cluster-level permissions, prevents the deployment of unauthorized resources that could impact the stability and security of the infrastructure. It also applies to **operators** and **Helm Charts**, with limitations on **RBAC** permissions.

**Non-certified CRDs** may be rejected to maintain cluster integrity. Only **CRDs from certified operators or Helm Charts** are allowed, following validation by our services.

Our support team can guide you through this process and advise on best practices to follow.

### Removal of Support for Dynamic IP Addresses for Runners

**OpenShift SecNumCloud runners** must be configured with **static IP addresses**.

This requirement ensures secure access to **OpenShift APIs**, administration interfaces, and access management tools in the **Cloud Temple** console.

**Dynamic IP addresses are not supported**, requiring appropriate configuration to ensure connectivity and security of the components.

## Useful Information

• If hardware components at the platform level become obsolete and a migration to new compute resources is required, Cloud Temple handles all hardware migrations at no additional cost and without service interruption.

• To test OpenShift, Cloud Temple does not provide a dedicated environment, but you can use [RedHat's test platforms](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it).

• For infrastructure automation, prioritize the official OpenShift Terraform provider.
