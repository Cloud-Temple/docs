Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Temple products are available on a pay-as-you-go basis or with a 12-month reservation.

**Notes**:

1. *Maintaining the operational and security conditions of the control plane is the responsibility of Cloud Temple as part of a PaaS service.*

2. *As of June 15, 2024, version 1 of the platform is deliberately software-limited to a control plane with 30 worker nodes (regardless of the type of worker) and a global persistent storage of 50 TB. If these limits are blocking for your project, please contact support.*

3. *Each worker node comes with 512GB of flash block storage, totaling 1.5 TB for each work unit (1 worker per AZ).*


4. *A worker node can manage up to 250 pods by default. This number is adjustable via the `podsPerCore` parameter - for example, with 10 pods per core on a 4-core node, you will have a maximum of 40 pods. For more technical details, consult the [pod management documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-managing-max-pods.html) and the [OpenShift Limits Guide](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.html).*

5. *The OpenShift PaaS offering natively includes access to 3 availability zones without the need for additional subscription.*

6. *It is possible to add block storage to the OpenShift cluster later.*

7. *Nodes are deployed evenly across the 3 availability zones (1 node per zone). It is not possible to unbalance a cluster by assigning a greater number of nodes to a single zone.*

## Backup Strategy for Your OpenShift PaaS Platform

The backup and restoration of the OpenShift PaaS platform is the responsibility of Cloud Temple for the **ETCD** part as part of platform management. **Backup and restoration for the deployment and application data part are the responsibility of the Sponsor**.

Cloud Temple offers its clients the **Veeam Kasten K10** (Veeam [**Kasten K10**](https://www.veeam.com/fr/kubernetes-native-backup-and-restore.html)), a platform specialized in data management for Kubernetes environments. Designed to meet data protection needs, it offers robust features for backup, restoration, migration, and disaster recovery. Kasten K10 integrates natively with Kubernetes environments, whether managed on cloud clusters or on-site, and can adapt to various use cases, including cluster migration between different Kubernetes distributions such as Vanilla Kubernetes, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat Kubernetes Engine, and Red Hat OpenShift.

One of the major use cases for Kasten K10 is **cluster migration between different Kubernetes platforms**. Whether transitioning to a more robust infrastructure or consolidating existing environments, Kasten K10 provides simple and effective tools to manage these migrations:

 - **Data backup and protection**: when migrating a Vanilla Kubernetes or VMware Tanzu cluster to Red Hat Kubernetes Engine or OpenShift, the first step is to back up the application data and their states. Kasten K10 easily integrates with Kubernetes APIs to identify applications, their dependencies, and associated data volumes. This includes backing up Persistent Volumes (PV), databases, configurations, and secrets. Kasten K10 supports a wide variety of storage providers (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc.), allowing the creation of snapshots of applications to be migrated. These backups are then securely stored with encryption options and granular access control, ensuring data security throughout the process.

 - **Portability and migration**: migration between Kubernetes distributions like Vanilla or Tanzu and Red Hat solutions like OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine can be complex due to architectural differences and specific configurations of each platform. Kasten K10 simplifies this process by providing an abstraction layer for application portability. During migration, Kasten K10 replicates the configurations and data from a source cluster to a target cluster, taking into account the specifics of each environment. For example, Kubernetes objects such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVs, and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) can be migrated considering the constraints specific to each Kubernetes distribution, whether it is a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine cluster. The process is automated, significantly reducing the risk of manual errors. Additionally, Kasten K10 allows for progressive or complete migration depending on needs and offers real-time visibility into the migration status, facilitating transition management and monitoring.

 - **Multi-cloud and multi-distribution compatibility**: Kasten K10 is designed to operate in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, making it an ideal tool for organizations looking to migrate applications from Tanzu or Vanilla clusters to Red Hat environments in the cloud (Cloud Temple, Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE) or on-premises infrastructures. This ensures maximum flexibility and allows DevOps teams to choose the best environment based on business needs or infrastructure modernization strategies.

 - **Simplified management and automation**: Kasten K10 offers an intuitive user interface that allows administrators to easily manage migration and backup operations without requiring in-depth expertise of each Kubernetes platform. The solution is also equipped with automation features that allow recurring migration and backup policies to be defined, integrating with CI/CD pipelines for continuous operations. Users can schedule migrations or restorations based on maintenance windows, perform validation tests after migration, and automate failover processes in case of issues on the source cluster.

 - **Security and compliance**: in the context of migrations to critical environments like Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes Engine, data security and compliance with standards (ISO, SOC, GDPR, etc.) are essential aspects. Kasten K10 ensures data encryption in transit and at rest while offering audit and traceability options for backup and restoration operations. These capabilities are essential for ensuring the security of migrated data, whether in production or test environments. Kasten K10 is an indispensable solution for companies wishing to efficiently and securely migrate Vanilla Kubernetes or VMware Tanzu clusters to Red Hat Kubernetes Engine or OpenShift.

 Billing is done based on the number of worker nodes.

## Current Limits of the Redhat Openshift Offer in a SecNumCloud Environment

Here are some limitations induced by the SecNumCloud qualification:

### Dedicated Control Plane

Workloads cannot be run on the control plane due to inherent restrictions in resource management and the security of the OpenShift platform on SecNumCloud.

### Prohibition of Deploying Images with Elevated Privileges (Rootless)

To comply with the security requirements of the SecNumCloud repository, it is mandatory to use rootless containers.

This approach reinforces overall security by preventing any privileged access to the containers. Applications requiring containers with privileges need to be modified, as their deployment will not be allowed.

This restriction also extends to Helm Charts and operators that use non-rootless images, making their deployment impossible within the infrastructure.

### Restrictions on ClusterRole Rights

As part of our OpenShift offering, we enforce stringent access rights management at the cluster level, in compliance with SecNumCloud requirements.

This approach involves limiting ClusterRoles for our clients, thereby restricting certain aspects of overall cluster management. Although this measure may initially seem constraining, it aims to enhance the security and stability of the infrastructure.

We are aware that this can lead to technical challenges, especially in configuring advanced settings, and potentially implications related to adapting your applications or acquiring additional tools.

Our support team is available to guide and advise you on this topic.

### SCC Context Cannot Be Modified in SecNumCloud Environment

Security Context Constraints (SCC) are subject to strict restrictions and cannot be modified by users. This limitation has significant repercussions on the deployment and execution of containers.

In practice, this means that container runtime settings, such as system access privileges or Linux capabilities, are predefined and non-customizable.

This measure, motivated by security requirements, aims to prevent any unauthorized access to critical cluster resources. Therefore, applications requiring specific security contexts, particularly those requiring privileged access, may face deployment barriers.

Technically, this may involve revising the architecture of applications and adapting deployment processes to comply with predefined SCCs. Operationally, this constraint may reduce the flexibility of deployments and increase the complexity of managing certain applications in the OpenShift environment, especially those using Helm Charts or operators that do not comply with the prevailing SCCs.

### Limitations on Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

To comply with the SecNumCloud qualification, a significant restriction concerns the use of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers. This measure, related to cluster rights, aims to prevent the deployment of potentially unstable or unauthorized custom resources.

This limitation also applies to operators and Helm Charts, with a direct impact on RBAC rights, as CRDs extend the Kubernetes API. Consequently, operators and Helm Charts must go through a certification process with our services to ensure their compliance and security.
Les CRDs personnalis√©es, notamment celles r√©pondant √† des besoins m√©tiers sp√©cifiques, peuvent √™tre refus√©es dans l'infrastructure en raison des risques qu'elles pr√©sentent pour la stabilit√© et la s√©curit√© de la plateforme. Cette politique, con√ßue pour prot√©ger l'int√©grit√© et la fiabilit√© du cluster, n'autorise que les CRDs provenant d'op√©rateurs ou de Helm Charts officiellement certifi√©s.

Notre √©quipe de support est disponible pour vous guider et vous conseiller sur les bonnes pratiques √† adopter dans ce cadre.

### No support for Dynamic IPs for runners

The OpenShift SecNumCloud platform requires that runners be configured with fixed IP addresses. This requirement is motivated by the need to authorize the IPs that manage our Cloud Temple console, necessary for the API access management tool. The authorized IP addresses are also used to access the OpenShift API as well as the administration interfaces of OpenShift and Shiva.

As a result, the use of dynamic IP addresses is not supported for these components, requiring the configuration of fixed IPs to ensure security and access to the APIs.

## Load Balancers

The SecNumCloud Openshift environment offers Load Balancing options at different levels to ensure secure and efficient traffic management. The Load Balancer API is accessible via ports 6443 and 443, with security control ensured by a whitelist managed by the Cloud Temple console. This API uses a public IP address connected to our backbone, but it is not accessible by default, thus enhancing access security.

For the private Load Balancer, the environment uses Ingress (nginx) as the default solution, allowing efficient management of internal traffic. Additionally, TCP support is available via the Cloud Temple IaaS infrastructure, offering additional flexibility for applications that require load balancing at this level.

Regarding the public Load Balancer, level 4 support is provided via Ingress, although some limitations currently exist with the "expose" command. This means that the system is capable of handling TCP and UDP connections reliably while continuing to evolve to offer greater compatibility and flexibility.

**Note**: the integrated Load Balancer does not serve as a WAF. A WAF as a Service offering is planned for the second half of 2025.

## Good to know

‚Ä¢ If the hardware components at the platform level become obsolete and a migration to new computing resources is necessary, Cloud Temple takes care of all hardware migrations at no additional cost and without service interruptions.

‚Ä¢ To test OpenShift, Cloud Temple does not provide a dedicated environment, but you can use [RedHat's test platforms](https://www.redhat.com/fr/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/try-it).

‚Ä¢ For automating your infrastructure, prioritize the official OpenShift Terraform provider rather than Cloud Temple's provider.
