# Containerization: Accelerator of Your Digital Transformation

In an era of accelerated digital transformation, the ability to rapidly develop, deploy, and evolve applications has become a decisive competitive advantage. Containerization, orchestrated through platforms such as Kubernetes and OpenShift, addresses this challenge by delivering unmatched agility, portability, and operational efficiency.

However, the inherent complexity of these technologies can represent a barrier. That’s why Cloud Temple has developed a range of managed, "as a Service" solutions that enable you to harness the full power of containers while relieving you of the burden of managing their complexity. Our offerings are designed to allow you to focus on your core business: application innovation—on a sovereign, trusted foundation.

## Which solution for your project?

Choosing a containerization platform is a strategic decision. Here are some key considerations to help you select the most suitable offering for your context.

*   **If regulatory compliance is your absolute priority...**
    ...and you operate in a highly regulated sector (public, healthcare, finance) or need to certify your own solution, the **OpenShift PaaS Offering** is the reference solution, providing the highest level of market assurance.

*   **If you value open source, modernity, and "zero-trust" security...**
    ...and your enterprise culture strongly emphasizes open source, independence from vendors, and next-generation security approaches (immutable systems, API-driven management), the **Managed Kubernetes Offering** best aligns with your vision.

Our advisory role is to support you in making this decision. Our architects are available to analyze your context and jointly define the optimal path forward.
