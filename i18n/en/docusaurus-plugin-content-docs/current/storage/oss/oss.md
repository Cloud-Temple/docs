**S3 object storage** is a key solution for managing unstructured data at scale, such as files, documents, or databases. Based on the standard AWS S3 protocol, this technology offers a resilient and scalable architecture, allowing for efficient storage, security, and access to data via REST APIs. Each file, called an "object", is contained in a "bucket", a logical space for organizing data and defining access rules.

Cloud Temple's object storage infrastructure relies on Dell's **Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS)** solution, known for its compatibility with the S3 protocol and high performance. This solution ensures exceptional availability and durability through advanced techniques like **Erasure Coding** and replication across multiple availability zones. With **97% compatibility with AWS S3**, it offers a smooth transition and standardized management for businesses.

To secure the data, Cloud Temple offers advanced encryption options: **server-side** (with keys managed by Cloud Temple or by the client) or **client-side**, offering complete control to the user. Certified **SecNumCloud**, **HDS**, and **ISO 27001**, this infrastructure guarantees strict compliance with regulatory requirements and the highest security standards.
