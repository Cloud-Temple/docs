The **S3 Object Storage** is a key solution for managing large-scale unstructured data, such as files, documents, or databases. Based on the standard AWS S3 protocol, this technology offers a resilient and scalable architecture, allowing to store, secure, and access data efficiently via REST APIs. Each file, called an "object," is contained in a "bucket," a logical space allowing to organize data and define access rules.

The Cloud Temple object storage infrastructure is based on Dell's **Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS)** solution, recognized for its compatibility with the S3 protocol and high performance. This solution ensures exceptional availability and durability through advanced techniques such as **Erasure Coding** and replication across multiple availability zones. With **97% compatibility with AWS S3**, it offers a smooth transition and standardized management for enterprises.

To secure data, Cloud Temple offers advanced encryption options: **server-side** (with keys managed by Cloud Temple or the customer) or **client-side**, providing full control to the user. Certified **SecNumCloud**, **HDS**, and **ISO 27001**, this infrastructure guarantees strict compliance with regulatory requirements and the highest security standards.
