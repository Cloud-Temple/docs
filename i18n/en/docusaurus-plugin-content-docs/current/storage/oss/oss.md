# Object Storage Service (OSS)

## Overview

Cloud Temple's Object Storage Service (OSS) is a highly scalable, durable, and secure storage solution designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

Built on a S3-compatible API, our OSS service is ideal for a wide range of use casesâ€”from backup and archiving to hosting static content for web applications, as well as storing data for Big Data analytics and cloud-native applications.

## SecNumCloud Certification

Like all Cloud Temple services, the object storage service fully complies with the requirements of the **SecNumCloud certification** issued by ANSSI. This ensures:

-   **Data sovereignty**: Your data is stored exclusively in France.
-   **Maximum security**: Robust encryption mechanisms protect your data at rest and in transit.
-   **High availability**: A redundant architecture ensures the durability and availability of your data.

## Primary Use Cases

-   **Backup and Restore**: Store your server, database, and application backups securely and cost-effectively.
-   **Long-Term Archiving**: Preserve large volumes of data for compliance purposes or future analysis.
-   **Static Content**: Host images, videos, and other static files for your websites and applications.
-   **Big Data & Data Lakes**: Centralize large datasets for your analytics and machine learning pipelines.
-   **Cloud-Native Applications**: Use reliable and high-performance storage for data generated by your containerized applications.
