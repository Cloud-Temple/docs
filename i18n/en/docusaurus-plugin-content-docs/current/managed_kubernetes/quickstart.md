title: Getting Started Guide

Welcome to the **Managed Kubernetes** Cloud Temple Getting Started Guide.

The goal of this section is to guide you toward the resources needed to get started with your cluster.

### Before you begin

To interact with your cluster, two elements are essential:

1.  **The `kubeconfig` file**: This file, provided to you by the Cloud Temple teams upon service delivery, contains all the information required to securely connect to the cluster.
2.  **The `kubectl` tool**: This is the standard command-line interface used to manage a Kubernetes cluster.

### Your First Steps

Your first mission is to verify the connection to your cluster, then deploy a test application to get familiar with the environment.

We've prepared a complete tutorial that guides you step by step through these tasks.
